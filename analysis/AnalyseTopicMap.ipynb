And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]</td>\n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]</td>\n",

Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]  \n",

And then maybe there are people who honestly try to do their job, who are harassed by the State, a bit of healthy fair competition., We decided to introduce a forty percent tax on the unfair difference in the interest margin, that is, what is the unfair difference in the interest margin is the difference between the amount of interest expense and interest income of banks, that is, the difference on how much the banks charge you to lend you money and how much they recognize you when you deposit the money.]  \n",

And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]  \n",

          "the thing that scares me the most, paradoxically, is not being able to tell italians that this government is proceeding with determination, with head held high, without wasting a minute and with the awareness that this nation can recover despite the bad weather that there are many.",
          "the reform of the land register, is consistent with the guidelines of the p n r r and responds to the recommendations made by the commission european union to italy on the subject of fiscal policy is written in the government document.",
          "when things go well, so dear italians, know that it will get worse, it will get worse with the electoral campaign, it will get worse, but as the vote for the political elections gets closer.",
          "the accusation of an italian brotherhood that scares us, an unpresentable, xenophobic, fascist movement and so on and so forth begins again.",
          "i can speak very badly about italy, but i do it in my home, i do it in parliament, i do it with my opponents, i do it with the italians at home, but outside you won't hear me speaking badly about italy, i have done something interview with fox news and i didn't do it to speak badly of italy in case the left won, i did it to say what i want to do, i did it to explain that this nation can get back on its feet, that this nation it can still be a proud nation, it can be a nation that amazes, as it has amazed throughout its history throughout its civilization.",
          "except that it is a proud italy that does not change its position from one day to the next because as long as i am in government, this italy i want to represent a woman at the helm of the democratic party.",
          "we told our elders that we consider them important and that we will take care of them from the release of the european agreement on the taxation of multinationals, in which italy had a fundamental role in the regulation to put a ceiling on the salaries of the managers of the banks saved by the state until the changes to the super bonus so that its abuse could be prevented.",
          "let's say that i no longer put on a good face at a bad situation if i don't have guarantees that those who are my allies want to be in this half field, that is, salvini's republican party which launches the republican party with berlusconi does not concern her.. no, it doesn't concern me.",
          "for italy in recent years we always said yesterday no on development cooperation, that is, when there is no water there are those who bring bottles of water and there are those who bring a dinner, that is, those who want to leave the autonomy the freedom of the nations in which it cooperates, so that that nation can grow and the sign of italian cooperation has always been like this.",
          "we in the classrooms and in the squares will continue to fight to represent all those italians who ask for answers and who do not give up on this reality.",
          "the pres is a victory for the italian government.",
          "in short, i consider it an excellent starting point, the result of important italian work, not only political, but also of our diplomacy and therefore i am, let's say, quite optimistic president on economic dossiers.",
          "because if you are the first to say that we will lose it is difficult for the voters to believe in the victory in lucca, for example, where we were united, we also managed to aggregate civic lists from various backgrounds.",
          "for us, the partnership with tunisia should be considered a model for building new relationships with our neighbors in north africa.",
          "it is not the first point according to what results it has brought, that is, other nations which have not bent the rights of the people in this way, which have not taken the debate to such extremes, which have not pitted italians against each other, but which have only explained i want see who is sixty-six percent.",
          "in many years of government, the left has not been able to offer answers to the economic crisis, and has, indeed, aggravated the effects with foolish policies that are light years away from the real needs of the people.. with brothers of italy this will never happen again.",
          "but obviously italy continues to be fully committed to our contribution, the all-round contribution because we are aware of how we have said it several times?",
          "the italian foreign minister, paid with italian money, goes around the world to discredit this nation in an attempt to garner a vote.",
          "what is the italian government doing?",
          "and then measures to increase the incentives that lead researchers who have fled abroad to return to italy.",
          "it has always been said that the left in italy has cultural hegemony.",
          "if we have brothers from italy as a driving force, we have the certainty that the government with the democratic party does not exist because i do not have a government with the left five-star democratic party, renzi and company..",
          "i came here simply to tell you that italy should leave the work you do, on days when you normally don't.",
          "perhaps you have some difficulty in explaining to italians why in a moment like this, in a moment in which we are heading towards a dramatic autumn on a social, economic and cost-of-living level, you are dealing with a matter which, first of all, is not priority at this moment and second point?",
          "look, if the secretary of the second italian party doesn't distinguish dissent from censorship, in italy we have a problem, a little more.",
          "sorry, no clothing, i'm on holiday, but i thought i should say a few words about the high bills, electricity and gas and inflation which are devastating italian families and companies.",
          "here, the objective of this government is to have rather than more europe in italy, more italy in europe, in a condition of equal dignity with the member states, as befits a great founding nation, it means not limiting oneself to ratifying the downstream choices, but to contribute to defining those choices upstream, to make the voc, the voice of our nation, heard strongly, to direct european integration towards more effective responses to the great challenges of our time and towards a more attentive approach to the needs of citizens, families and businesses.",
          "on the one hand on the other we must also be aware of a co-coalition bond which requires a great sense of responsibility and we are in government of the nation for us clearly acting inter, doing our best, acting in italy's interests is priority.",
          "to divert citizens' attention from the reality they are experiencing, the entire mainstream is deployed to prevent them from protesting against a government that is objectively a little late to avoid yet another blow that is about to hit italians.",
          "this is why i am even more convinced today that a conservative turn is needed in the west, in the united states, in europe, in italy..",
          "in short, also so in short, seeing and talking directly with people can help to dismantle a narrative that has been made about the current about the undersigned often and about the italian government.",
          "jesus, giorgia meloni, j. carron, sanka gesù, the president of Brothers of Italy left her parts preserved italian Brothers of Italy and draghi Brothers of Italy her parts and that the time and the deterioration, the the the the, the the the the the the surviving tragic, the soviet union for the misma bla of freedom, positioning of the current world and in what i don't know, we synergistically put in casts anti-democratic drift with palabras signatures that we don't always encounter if the group is italian, european and even in the next one is the change represented for brothers of italy, however, of western freedom to maintain the farm during agnos and of garrisons the european conservative party which with the stories and american israeli position in the western field is crystal clear with the pink aggression against ukraine, the contribute to bring if the italian position in europe and internationally our idea of ​​europe and slade is a political entity capable of representing an additional real value with less bureaucracy, the greats assumed that it shoots the future of italy csl dynamic and presides over the world that has contributed to large europe.",
          "we are working on this thanks to the position of the italian government.",
          "bonaccini promised an opposition, i would say severe, but collaborative.",
          "because if we think we are giving a simple answer to an extremely complex issue, we risk creating more damage than we think we can resolve, which he also asked the territories of emilia romagna to do.",
          "it is a system of power that is twisting because they know well that if the center-right and the brothers of italy come to government, we will build a nation in which you don't move forward because maybe you are better friends and closer to the left.",
          "and this is usually what people do like this i and the government went as you know, in calabria on the same day and this tragedy happened the government is me.",
          "now the funny thing is that if you had also read the other pages of this document, you would have discovered that on the first page there is something very clear written and that is that that document was a series of contributions from people external to brothers of italy that we had called together and asked for their contributions and wrote us their provocations.",
          "what i can say is that a centre-right government led by the brothers of italy would do everything it could to continue this process and to allow chico to at least finally be able to see his daughter.",
          "it seems clear to me that for several months we have been witnessing a migratory pressure that has few precedents across the central mediterranean, towards europe and therefore towards italy.",
          "because you see, when you tell millions of italians that i am a danger, a dangerous person for history, a person who could paradoxically kill millions of people, invade a state or do things that the people with whom i am lumped together have done.",
          "partly due to an ideological approach, because security, after all, for them is a right-wing thing, state intervention is needed immediately, now the restoration of security and legality and the fight against degradation are among the priorities of the brothers of italy, starting from greater control of the territory.",
          "that is, i ask him, but looking into your eyes, if any of you think that the italian government could have saved sixty people, including a child of about three years old whose body we discovered today and he didn't do it, please, let's try to be a minimum serious.",
          "yesterday the brothers of italy questioned the minister of the interior luciana lamorgese on this issue in parliament and the minister, for a change, had no answers to give on the issue.",
          "i have been director president of the european conservatives for two years and raffaele fitto bears witness to me.",
          "so i continue to read and listen to imaginative reconstructions on the electoral political program of the brothers of italy for these elections which force me, let's say, to clarify some rather banal things because before i saw comments which circulated some sentences taken from the political program of the elections of two thousand eighteen.",

          "and a system that gives stability to the government, an institutional system worthy of a great western nation like italy to return to being protagonists in europe and in the world to return to investing in our future, to return to growth and prosperity",
          "it is a battle in which italy continued with determination and this led to the end, despite there being great resistance to bring the whole of europe to a proposal that in short we were among the first, if not the first, to do, which is a huge signal for italian and european families and businesses and shows that in short, when you take a little with determination and a little stubbornness the results can come.",
          "there is no need to reach an agreement with the mafia to beat it, it can be done and today italy has demonstrated it.",
          "okay, that's a risk that the italian state ran as we know because there were rulings from the constitutional court of the echr, the european court which said that prison imprisonment is essentially unconstitutional and with the fall of the previous government there was a risk of not arriving in time with a parliamentary amendment that would secure this fundamental tool in the fight against the mafia.",
          "i consider it shameful that enrico letta does an interview on c n n not to explain what he will do to the government of this nation, but to try to tell this nation abroad that if the center right wins the center right supported by more than half on paper of italian citizens.",

          "we are also doing it in these days of support in favor of the states of north africa, tunisia in the lead, because tunisia is experiencing a profound crisis, with consequences that can be very worrying for italy and not only do we want to be an impetus to all of europe for a new relationship with africa.",

          "then even funnier than this is the reason why brothers of italy could not govern even if the citizens, a sovereign people, voted for it because it is an illiberal party, which is an illiberal party because it is against the reform of the land registry, is an illiberal party, because it is opposed to the expropriation of beach businesses by the government to auction off the establishments and give them to foreign multinationals.",
          "in this dramatic phase, however, we will not accept that the international crisis becomes yet another pretext for trampling on italian democracy.",
          "the results once again disprove the predictions and make us responsible to do more and more, to do better, aware as we are that a strong and credible italy outside national borders means above all an italy capable of affirming the interests and needs of its citizens.",
          "and for me this is a very important element, because the italian government's approach completely changes compared to what we have seen in recent years.",
          "today you have to accept that there is another government that has been chosen by italians to carry out exactly the policy it is carrying out.",
          "instead we asked ourselves whether there should be more or less italy in europe.",
          "sometimes we will agree, we will be able to do things together, sometimes we will not agree, but i guarantee you that those requests will always be listened to seriously and without prejudice, because this is the commitment i have made in towards all italians and it is one of many commitments that i intend to carry forward, thank you.",

          "i don't agree, the left in italy has a hegemony of power which is another thing, that is, the left has built a society in which by occupying, let's say a series of spaces, an italy is built, so whoever is anyone who thinks differently is considered a kind of pariah in society and i believe that this is the problem, that is, in the end perhaps the hypothesis of a real change,",

          "because the other thing, which makes me a little angry, nicola, is it possible that we never manage to celebrate, is it possible that we always have to flagellate ourselves that when the italian state, finally in a moment in which we have a thousand problems, can claim victory?",
          "the theme here is if you want to do something, whatever you want to do, you do it respecting the rules and laws of the italian state because there isn't some idiot who respects them and someone else who doesn't have to respect them, this italy here, as i see it, it's over, that is, someone who knows how to do it better make their proposals but don't use hypotheses that have nothing to do with the rationale of the law and with our intention to prevent this state from saying that we are no longer the banana republic, because i don't follow them on this, i move forward and i believe that this is what italians expect from me and from the government currently in office",
          "so i turn to free italians, be aware of the fact that this game that is being played on my skin is actually being played to cheat you, because until we return to elections they will do everything to tarnish us, to prevent people from opposing the policies of this government, to prevent people from voting the way they don't want.",

          "did you expect, after the trips with the fun de line to tunis, that france and germany would suddenly say, keep them,",
          "i simply think that the problem of the left is that it is a bit short on arguments and you know why it is short on arguments it is short on arguments because we, by governing, are dismantling the narrative of an unpresentable right, of an authoritarian right , of a right incapable of governing and we are demonstrating in italy and beyond national borders that it can exist instead.",
          "in short, the council of ministers, the government are there, the other institutional levels are also there, there is a level of collaboration here which is very precious in a situation like this, it was a tragedy, but we can always be reborn from crises strong and therefore it can also be an opportunity to demonstrate how concrete and immediate italy knows how to be in terms of damage estimates.",
          "we will be in the opposition enrico, you and your party have allied yourself in order to stay in government with the five star movement, forza italia, lega, fratoianni, bonino, tabacci let's change our minds with italy, di maio's svp party.",

          "and which can be projected from now to the political elections it will be difficult to do without brothers of italy in the pro- in the next legislature.",
          "because the strongest power of all remains that of the italian people and the italians have understood that there is a party that defends their interests while there are others that defend those of the party itself.",
          "i consider it a maneuver, consistent with the commitments that we have made with the italian people.",

          "italy has worked a lot in recent years, above all with the aim of representing more, how can i say, a limit rather than a stimulus to the creation of wealth.",
          "and this is the reason why today i sent a letter to the european council and the european commission to ask that what we discussed at the last ukrainian european council meeting be immediately made concrete, we saw her moved in front of the children's soft toys killed on the bus and you confirmed to zaleski the full support of the italian government, despite an important part of public opinion being against the sending of weapons, i was moved by some soft toys in the rain in memory of some children because my daughter has some a similar one and however i also want to tell you that i thought that italians should be very proud of them instead.",
          "the behavior of the italian left is scandalous on this, as it remains silent so as not to annoy anyone in europe.",

          "this instability has produced our economic weakness, it has produced the credibility problems that we may have also had at an international level, when our interlocutors often remain the same interlocutor for at least a few years and every time they sit with an italian exponent they ask themselves the next once again, who knows if this person will be my interlocutor again on the part of italy and they have produced the disaffection on the part of the citizens that we see and to deliver to italy a reform which, let's be clear, we are doing for ourselves, because it is a reform which we hand over to the next government and therefore we hand over to all the political forces.",
          "i mean, but according to you, i'm talking about enrico letta when i say what i want italy to do because unfortunately, not being able to say we'll do this while they've been in government for ten years and we've seen them at work, they try to throw it all on the monster.",
          "i've been saying it for three years now, you will remember the great demonstration at which we launched the project of an italian conservative party.",
          "they have the problem that they told you for many years that the left in italy had cultural hegemony, but it wasn't true.",
          "the agreement reached in europe on the gas price cap is a great italian victory.",
          "it is above all an insult towards people who are sacrificing their lives to achieve, to allow italy to achieve these victories there are people who work twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, shadowing, listening of hours and hours and hours of phone calls who are there they don't see their family, they don't go on holiday, they don't they don't they don't they don't they don't take holidays anything to allow us to win.",
          "and in the meantime let's clarify something banal, none of this stuff is the brothers of italy program for these political elections, because we are still writing the brothers of italy program for these political elections, we are finalizing it, we will publish it when we deliver it , that is, in the next two weeks, when we have to hand it over by law.",
          "in recent years many people have been overwhelmed by economic difficulties and a perverse system, instead of helping them, has ended up taking away their homes too.",
          "it is a proposal which, thanks to Brothers of Italy, then led to the establishment of the is, an extraordinary allowance intended for self-employed workers in separate management in the event of a strong reduction in income produced..",
          "it is not a measure to favor the rich, there is an increase in the flat tax to fifteen percent for the self-employed, which until now was linked to a turnover of, let's say, sixty-five thousand euros and is being raised to eighty-five thousand and there is for the employee jobs.",
          "in essence, the larger the family, the less taxes are paid, but we immediately intend to make an immediate tangible contribution to all families.",
          "it concerns the increase for incredibly disabled children in the single allowance.",
          "if a council of ministers is needed even in the next few hours to approve the necessary measures immediately, it can be done easily using resources.",
          "so let's say about what has been done the most with a maximum threshold of forty thousand euros, which means that the measure is a measure aimed at the middle class.",
          "it must be done in such a way as not to obviously create disparities within the single market and therefore, for example.",
          "and then as the pension increases, let's say the increase, this maneuver decreases.",
          "and then on the financing of summer centers to help reconcile life, work and family and on the subject of a single allowance for children and then the citizen's income as we promised.",
          "today there is one that particularly concerns those one million three hundred thousand families who have greater difficulty in purchasing basic necessities, the famous dear cart.",
          "the house is the primary asset around which people build their future, around which they imagine their old age.",
          "increases that can even reach one hundred euros for workers with the lowest incomes.",
          "those like us who in just a few months have cut the contribution wedge by up to seven points for the lowest incomes, increasing the net paycheck to workers, have reduced taxes on productivity bonuses, have increased the exemption threshold for prins benefits, have the season of public sector contract renewals has started, for example with the renewal of the school staff contract.",
          "the card dedicated to you is a card that is activated and allows these families to have around four hundred one hundred euros to spend in shops for the purchase of basic necessities.",
          "and this is interesting because i remember when someone who invented this measure went around during the election campaign saying that thanks to him you were able to renovate your house for free.",
          "from the beginning it is the reason why in this, in these less than a year, we have concentrated the few resources we had at our disposal on cutting the contribution wedge, that is, putting more money in people's paychecks.",
          "still on the subject of the single allowance, another measure that may seem obvious, but is not.",
          "for those in absolute poverty we have strengthened solidarity towards the most vulnerable.",
          "with a simple and responsible proposal, namely to adequately strengthen the instrument of the single universal allowance.",
          "and an invalid gets me a disability pension of two hundred and seventy euros and an elderly person gets me a social pension of five hundred and three euros.",
          "we have cut labor taxes by a further point for an entire year and i tell you more, with the money that was spent in nine months to cut excise duties by the previous government, it would have been possible to have cut labor taxes by approximately seven points, which meant putting up to two hundred euros a month in the pockets of workers with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros.",
          "and disabled people get a disability pension of two hundred and seventy euros.",
          "well, by reducing the tax wedge, i.e.",
          "so yes, i believe that a limit should be introduced on the income of those who access this measure.",
          "i believe that, in short, let's say it is a fundamental condition that disabled children obviously have more than others and therefore we have made vat on all products a structural measure.",

          "the increase for disabled children was considered, let's say, transitory.",
          "today the law provides, in extreme summary, a contribution for each dependent child from a minimum of fifty euros to a maximum of one hundred and seventy-five euros per month in the case of isee up to the threshold of fifteen thousand euros.",
          "to achieve this objective we have increased the minimum pensions to six hundred euros.",
          "parents know this well, we will increase the single allowance by fifty percent which in this way will reach a maximum of two hundred and sixty euros per month per child.",
          "in the latest decree there is a rule that reimburses commuters for the sum they spend on public transport season tickets.",
          "the paradox today the paradox today is that perhaps you are a boy in excellent health and i will give you the citizen's income even up to seven hundred and eighty euros.",
          "but let's add a further one percent cut to the tax wedge, which therefore reaches three percent for incomes up to twenty thousand euros.",
          "so, in recent days there has been a lot of controversy over this amendment that was presented by the majority parties on the topic of the famous bonus for eighteen year olds.",
          "so the biggest increase in relation to let's say inflation will be the lowest pensions, all pensions up to two thousand euros and above are revalued by one hundred percent.",
          "so today and until the end of this year, we have a cut in the contribution wedge of six percentage points for those with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros and even of seven percentage points for the lowest incomes of up to twenty-five thousand euros.",
          "but certainly eighteen apps is a measure that in my opinion needs to be reviewed for some banal reasons, the first of which is that these five hundred euros are recognized for everyone upon reaching the age of eighteen, regardless of income.. and i sincerely think that there is no reason why the children of a millionaire of parliamentarians, my daughter, if she turned eighteen tomorrow, is much younger.",
          "in government documents it is written that the reform of the cadastre serves to do what we need europe is asking and that is to review our taxation by decreasing it on work and compensating the decrease in taxes on work with the revision of cadastral estimates.",
          "we cut the contribution wedge by four percentage points and this cut adds to what we had already done in the previous budget law.",
          "that is, to establish an instrument that also guarantees self-employed people, in the event of closure of their vat number, an unemployment benefit.",
          "we have also decided to help minimum pensions.",
          "we do this with a very complex series of measures, but the most important of these measures relates to the tax cut on.",
          "and you know, let's say that constitutionally a law that imposes greater burdens also needs individualized coverage.",
          "ten years of left-wing governments have made life impossible for those who want to do business, treated like criminals, like tax evaders, regardless thrown into the jungle of bureaucracy and tax big brother, oppressed by taxes that are too high.",

          "the confirmation of the fringe benefit, the liberal provision in favor of the worker completely tax-free at three thousand euros, dedicated in particular to workers with dependent children.",
          "okay, so let's forget that cutting the tax wedge, money on families, money on the health fund, anything you can think of couldn't be done.",
          "we have addressed the pension issue and we have done so seriously.",
          "and what we intend to do and what we are starting to do in part because in the financial package there is, for example, a total exemption from contributions for those who employ certain categories of people, including those receiving citizen's income.",
          "six points for incomes up to thirty-five thousand euros, seven points for incomes up to twenty-five thousand euros means increases in the paycheck that can reach one hundred euros.",
          "i think i could, let's say, give up the five hundred euros to buy her books or cultural content and i believe that the same measure concentrated on those who are in difficulty, those with the lowest incomes, could have a much greater impact..",
          "now with the reduction of the contribution wedge we are going there on the budget law.",
          "for early childhood it is increased to five percent.",
          "the citizen's income was a total failure, despite having had an exorbitant cost of around nine billion euros for the state.",
          "one hundred and twenty million euros have been allocated together with third sector associations, which i also thank for setting up the food bank, to further help families who are even more in difficulty.",
          "it is not fair that families and businesses always pay the price for the mistakes made in europe and made over the years by governments.",
          "the social bee is extended, the women's option is extended, albeit with some corrections, in my opinion to make the measure more balanced, there is the issue of the pension ladder.",
          "first of all, i heard that we raise money from the poor.",
          "the state, as you know, intervenes to reduce bills for families up to now with a maximum of twelve thousand euros of isee, we bring the twelve thousand euros to fifteen thousand euros of isee.",

          "an instrument based on the same rules as naspi, i.e.",
          "single allowance the single allowance is increased by fifty percent for everyone for the first year of the child's life it is increased by fifty percent for three years for families who have three children or more or more.",
          "i agree with the cut, but in my opinion the priorities now were different.",
          "in recent months the government has already increased hiring among those called to help.",
          "the measures for the facilitation of the purchase of the first home for young couples are confirmed, of which there are two, one relating to the registration tax and the other is the guarantee that the state covers up to eighty percent on mortgages for the first home for young couples and there is a measure that in my opinion is very important regarding parental leave.",
          "and already in the first months of the legislature, despite the inevitably limited resources we have available, we have given signals in this sense, interventions to protect the purchasing power of families and workers, the renewal of the two-point cut percentages of the tax and contribution wedge which it is worth remembering the previous government had foreseen until the end of last year and the addition of a further point of the contribution cut for the lowest incomes.",
          "even those who don't have a home, even a homeless person, even a child, even a newborn baby, have the expense of almost two thousand euros on their shoulders..",
          "at sixty-seven we intervene by extending the current regime with corrective measures, that is, the possibility of retiring at sixty-two with forty-one years of contributions, but here too with some common sense guidelines, the most important of which is that for those who decide , let's say you enter this window until you meet the requirements you will not be able to take a pension greater than five times the minimum.",
          "we not only confirm the two percent cut for incomes up to thirty-five thousand euros entirely on the worker's side which was already foreseen and which we have extended.",
          "now we will revalue pensions, we will revalue all pensions according to indexation, but we will do it with a different percentage based on how high the pension is.",
          "and then from the fifty percent increase in the single allowance for children to the halving of vat on early childhood products, through the strengthening of parental leave.",
          "it consists of voluntary registration on a platform that gives you access to various possibilities, participating in a training program during which you also receive an economic benefit of three hundred and fifty euros per month, or the possibility of participating in the national civil service even beyond the age that comes normally permitted for the civil service which also recognizes an economic benefit, the possibility of participating in public utility projects also with the recognition of an economic benefit.",
          "i can announce to you now that the budget law that we will present follows the trend of the previous one, that is, work income, which is what we have already done with all the main provisions of the previous one, starting from the extension of the audience of those who benefited, of the bonus for gas and electricity, up to, let's say, the first signals we have given on productivity bonuses.",
          "from the extension of the solidarity fund for mortgages and the guarantee fund for the purchase of the first home for young couples, through to the rule that allows everyone to transform the variable rate mortgage into a fixed rate mortgage, we have given a hand in defending the right to housing from the fiscal truce to the extension of the flat tax for self-employed and vat numbers, up to the cut in taxation on productivity bonuses and on the highest declared incomes, through the tax relief on tips and the extension of the suspension on plastic and sugar tax, we have begun to build a state that is friendlier to those who produce, from raising the ceiling to the use of cash to the norm to combat open-and-close companies.",
          "let's try to be serious, on the one hand there are us who are serious and on the other, there are you who have some objective difficulty in arguing about seriousness and therefore try to mystify but find another one",
          "but clearly anything that wants to be remotely serious has to have a cover.",
          "the point is you can only get anywhere, which you don't have to accept.",
          "but i can tell you that i am still confident and i can tell you that i am at peace with my conscience because in this year i physically could not have worked more.",
          "in fact, i consider it absolutely good news.",
          "face it head on.",
          "have the courage to come out of that shell in which you have taken refuge for years trying to destroy your opponent by attaching a label to him.",
          "it can be.",
          "and i return to the topic because you see, it's a fact.",
          "no, i have no regrets.",
          "well, i am moved, i am often moved, but i found many people moved, clearly moved by the tragedy they were experiencing, but also moved by speranza no and i was saying for us it is important to give immediate answers.",

          "let's say she's ready to go alone?",
          "you should know that i am not a person who is intimidated.",
          "and so i, who perhaps for too long have allowed people to go out of bounds because i am a person who has always said what he thinks, but i am never wrong in speaking, i don't need to use these tones, i don't need to use these methods to campaign against my opponents who today are all just talking about me.",
          "we reply that it has more than a future, it has eternity.",
          "so accompany us okay, the important thing is that you continue not to let the message be mediated.",
          "i believe that paradoxically it is a how can i say overconfidence?",
          "since i am a serious person, i expect the same seriousness from those who want to flea me",
          "so i have decided that in the meantime i will clearly sue all those who have allowed themselves to say a wrong word and not so much for me, because i will continue to move forward and i don't even look at these guys anymore..",

          "for this we have huge resources that come from the european social fund which serves exactly this objective.",

          "in particular cases of hardship with those same european funds, it is also possible to provide economic support during that training period.",
          "this maneuver reserves a lot of attention to the productive fabric.",
          "in any case, the resources needed will be identified to do things, that is, what interventions are already being thought of.",
          "in short, we continue to believe that imagining a sovereign fund to support businesses, working on full flexibility of existing funds must be issues to be discussed and put on the table at a time when some who have greater fiscal space than others ask for easing of rules on state aid, the mission of france, germany, washington was look, frankly, the invitation to zelanski yesterday seemed more inappropriate to me, because i believe that the strength, our strength in this matter is unity and compactness.",
          "after that, the european solidarity fund is a fund that in my opinion, for example, is one of the funds that can be used.",
          "these funds we are no longer talking about, clearly we in the next now we will also allocate other resources, which however are ten million for the emergency.",
          "part of these resources are recovered from a redefinition of the rule on extra profits which should overcome, let's say, some of the elements that were at the basis of the disputes that were raised and allow us to recover around two and a half billion.",

          "let's start immediately with concrete things.",
          "we eliminate the contribution.",
          "we have focused resources on those priorities.",
          "the possibility of partially using european funds can be agreed in europe, as has already been done in the past.",
          "this is perhaps now one of the most strategic things to do to understand where responsibility should lie, to understand how we can concentrate all the resources we have at what are now many institutional levels and try to concentrate them to immediately spend what we can spend.",
          "unfortunately, the provision, due to a rule that was objectively poorly written, gave rise to various frauds and led to an unjustified increase in the price of building materials.. to try to correct the initial errors, the government changed the rules for accessing and operating the fund several times during the course.",
          "six billion is a small thing compared to the tens and tens of billions currently thrown away in useless bonuses, we can take the resources from there.",
          "for example, with covid it is possible to seriously tax extra profits or in any case seriously recover the proceeds of those taxes, given that so far one billion out of the ten expected has been collected due to a rule that was evidently not written quite well.",
          "look, we made a maneuver of thirty billion out of those thirty billion, we invested twenty on what we had declared to be the priority and on which everyone agreed, which was the high bills.",
          "in any case, clearly many resources will have to be mobilized and here too the government is already working to understand what the priority funds can and should be, from which the priority situations from which to draw.",
          "now i know they are needed, let's say to widen the emergency, to allocate the resources needed for the emergency and are needed to make all the measures to exempt companies, citizens from paying taxes to slow down, to strengthen the bureaucracy, both for that that is needed here, but to instead stop all the obligations that people and companies today cannot, cannot carry out.",
          "there are ways to finance these interventions: the extra revenue can be used, i.e.",
          "then in the midst of an international crisis of a war, in the midst of a total economic emergency which sees bills increase by more than one hundred percent which probably sees the increase in the costs of raw materials, certainly of raw materials, probably basic necessities.",
          "we want to broaden the range of potential beneficiaries of the solidarity fund for victims of extortion and usury not only to economic activities, for example, but also to families and individuals.",
          "let's say that at a certain point if the state sees it, if the revenue agency sees it, let's say there is something that isn't working.",
          "for this reason, the objective of our work must also be to find the resources necessary to carry out these development initiatives, involving not only states and international organizations, but also enhancing private and entrepreneurial initiatives.. and i am sure that the discussion that we are about to start in this session, in the following one, which also involves international financial organizations and institutions, will direct us towards ambitious and shared goals.",
          "on the remaining ten billion we had two choices: either cut excise duties for everyone, even the rich, or take those resources and concentrate them on medium-low incomes which is the choice we made.",
          "the government has allocated over one billion euros for regions and autonomous provinces, to limit the impact of payback in medical devices, on companies in the sector and to strengthen emergency rooms.",
          "our entire productive fabric is at risk, with thousands of companies and many thousands of jobs at risk of no longer existing.",
          "errors that need to be corrected.",
          "the point is that the measure was written so badly and made so badly that it generated an enormous series of problems that we today have inherited and are required to try to resolve because the super bonus essentially had two big errors.",
          "but i believe that at this stage we need to work more on other funds that also concern europe.",
          "and above all, the state can intervene immediately to allocate more resources to reduce the bills of families and businesses with direct aid and tax credits.",
          "the twenty million are now used to guarantee paradoxical relief.",
          "ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by cgil, cisl and uil and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. now, in light of this, if i decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, i would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "paradoxically, to look after their interests, the large economic concentrations, which are the only ones that would gain from a generalized reduction in wages, are, let's say, within reach.",
          "i apologize for the addition of the protections guaranteed to workers, but a substitute parameter, a single parameter, and in our system a parameter of this type would risk, paradoxically, creating worse conditions for many workers than those they have today and paradoxically doing them a favor to large economic concentrations in which it is appropriate to review workers' rights downwards.",
          "now the question everyone is asking is whether i set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "fair work, paid adequately as this government has particularly demonstrated, putting most of its resources on cutting the contribution wedge, guaranteeing adequate wages and defending the purchasing power of families is one of our absolute priorities.",
          "that is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",
          "because obviously it's the risk that we end up with a minimum wage rule.",
          "and besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "above all, director, as you know, the issue of employee employment was our priority.",
          "that is, either here we understand that we need to get the economy moving again and that getting the economy moving again is the only way to guarantee wages and incomes.",
          "because if the legal minimum wage is the solution, why didn't the parties that are now clamoring for it introduce it in the long years in which they were in government?",
          "there are disagreements on what the tools are to strengthen the purchasing power of families, to strengthen wages.",
          "really who concentrated on increasing wages?",
          "but we are obviously open to discussion on the subject, which is much broader than poor work and adequate wages.",
          "in my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, i'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "these are obviously first steps towards the objective that the government has set itself, which is obviously to increase workers' wages, guaranteeing decent wages, wages that are adequate for the work performed and the socio-economic context.",
          "important rules on safety at work, on school-work alternation, on the safety of students who participate in school-work alternation, incentives for hiring young people equal to sixty percent of the salary they earn.",
          "risk that at a certain point someone decides to free the world from this very dangerous person, because maybe there are some wheels out of place and he doesn't understand the game there is.",
          "i believe that it is much more effective to extend collective bargaining even in sectors where it is not currently foreseen.",
          "a risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "because i believe that it is a job that needs to be done immediately, because i wanted to have this meeting today, let's say, forcing you to be here too because one thing that struck me about the opposition's proposal is that they foresee one thing in my opinion sensible, that is, to imagine compensation in the event that their proposal is approved for employers who have to face an increase in wages.",
          "the question therefore is whether you can give us a little more detail about the government's strategic choices for 2023 and also the timing, on the one hand to create more effective active policies for work which your party also called for when it was in opposition and which they will be useful to those who may lose their income within seven months and on the other to create conditions for a better quality of work.",
          "obviously on an economic level it is one of our great priorities and it clearly interests us when the question of strengthening wages is raised.",
          "for this reason i have chosen to meet the opposition starting from the specific proposal of the minimum wage because the issue of combating poor work interests us, as long as we understand the fact that the subject is an extremely broad subject and that it must be addressed in its entirety complexity.",
          "but then why didn't we accept the opposition's proposal on the legal minimum wage as it was presented?",
          "including legal minimum wage, which has not been approved in the past.",
          "for this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",
          "look, what i want to do is simply give a signal of attention and respect on an issue that is close to my heart, because unlike those who today propose a minimum wage from the opposition, but when they were in government they did not implement the minimum wage.",
          "but since the issue of support for working mothers and the issue of support for the birth rate is an absolute priority for us, i am always available to discuss and talk about this.",
          "if i'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "the cost of living is increasing and i really can't understand anyone who can even argue about this choice.",
          "another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "and i apologize to you for the simple minimum wage measure which, as you know, according to many also according to many trade unions, according to many experts in the sector, in a nation like ours, with very high collective bargaining, risks worsening, paradoxically, the condition more workers than those for whom it could improve it.",
          "but i want to say that to achieve this objective, i have already said it in the past, in a context like the italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "i am thinking of the issue of strengthening the lowest wages, particularly with the cut in the contribution wedge.",
          "these are measures that favor work.",
          "now, in my opinion, let's say he will question me on the hypothesis that the legal minimum wage could become not a substitute parameter and let's say a parameter.",
          "and imagine if he is not sensitive to the issue of increasing wages.",
          "to dispose of these credits.",
          "this change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "but it is obvious that a new credit, given that the superbonus measure continues to generate around three billion euros of credits per month.",
          "these are measures that circulate the economy and also the super bonus.",
          "it is the reason why we favor current spending over investments that have a significantly higher multiplier.",
          "do you intend to intervene to modify the functioning of the super bonus as in the immediate future?",
          "in our opinion, in this difficult situation it is essential for the banking system to behave, so to speak, in the most correct manner possible.",
          "you cannot assign the credit you have generated to another actor.",
          "families and entrepreneurs are increasingly resorting to usurious credit, because the banks, immobilized by regulations that are too stringent, are actually unable to respond to the current demand for credit.",
          "but it's obvious that for goodness' sake, if you take someone's credit and you haven't even gone to check whether not only the work has been done, but whether the property exists as happened, you are co-responsible because in short, a minimum of control should done, but if you couldn't have known some things.",
          "a reform of the anti-usury law is needed to overcome delays and bureaucratic cumbersomeness that until now have hindered the submission of complaints by victims.",
          "however, unfortunately this has not always happened and we are therefore recording record profits from many banking institutions.",
          "thanks to Brothers of Italy, a rule has been arrived at that corrects the issue of the joint liability of banks or in any case of suppliers in excess of the credits, who are now liable for their behavior only in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
          "which means that if we left the transferability of those credits throughout this year, at the end of this year we would have at least another forty million euros.",
          "on the other hand we said that in the future it will no longer be possible to exceed those credits.",
          "but the second and more complex question concerns the fact that the super bonus created by the then giallorossi government envisaged the possibility that the credit i had when i was doing the work towards the state could be transferable.",
          "but above all because obviously those who have to take out a loan prefer to do so on a new loan rather than an old one.",
          "unfortunately this impacts everyone, even the companies that have to take those credits, even those who have received the super bonus, even those who have not received the super bonus, on citizens.",
          "in addition to increasing the super bonus from one hundred and ten to ninety percent, we have already made a measure that allows the permitted period to be extended from five to ten years.",
          "because in all of this, since there have been many scams in this matter, obviously those who have to acquire the credit are afraid of being co-responsible for anyone who may have generated a scam.",
          "the one hundred and ten percent super building bonus is a measure created with the laudable intent of renewing our building stock for the ecological transition.",
          "trace who had generated that credit now you understand that such a system lends itself a little to scams and also lends itself a little to creating, no, a bubble that increases this mechanism.",
          "because it is obvious that if i have to put ten percent of what i am spending i will be more careful, more careful to look at how much i spend and to see if, for example, prices have not in some cases increased for no reason.",
          "and obviously it also happened that the bubble inflated so much that at a certain point those who had these credits, mainly companies, could no longer compensate them because they had exhausted, let's say, their possibility of compensating that credit with taxes and could no longer not even to sell them, because even the fiscal drawers of the banks of the other actors who could buy those credits have closed and there are perfectly honest people who have done some work, who have trusted the state, who have done what the state said which found itself in the hands of some work done and money that it cannot take because this has produced this very interesting free measure that today we have thousands of companies that risk collapse and therefore since we inherited it, we now have to look for a solution to prevent thousands of companies from risking collapse because someone could say during the election campaign that they renovated houses for free and that's exactly what we tried to do.",
          "a few days ago we also returned to dealing with the age-old issue of the super bonus.",
          "that is, it means that families spent more to buy less.",
          "this is where the exorbitant bills and huge extra profits that some are making come from.",
          "this is the reason why our government has already intervened, increasing the bonus from one hundred and ten percent to ninety percent.",
          "instead we want to push as much as possible banks, companies and all the actors involved to allow the acquisition of credits that are already at a standstill, those so-called stranded credits, i.e.",
          "we must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "we have made a rule that allows us to say don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
          "then on the topic of tax evasion i also want to say something because i have heard many things about the fact that this maneuver favors tax evaders.",
          "for this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",
          "the first is that we do not allow the purchase of those credits by the public administration, therefore regions and municipalities, because some were gearing up, obviously in an attempt to find a solution to do so, but there is a problem that these credits have practically generated a sort of parallel currency and that parallel currency risks impacting public budgets in a devastating way.",
          "above all because in our opinion this is one of the most effective ways to help the so-called exoduses of the one hundred and ten, that is, those companies that have remained in the hands of those people who have been left in the hands of credits and money for work done that they risk not seeing and therefore we must facilitate the purchase of those credits.",
          "this is the history.",
          "he learned that he should never give up.",
          "but there are many other important things that we decide today.",
          "when they choose you will carry forward your graces.",
          "you see, colleagues, we have we have always debated, sometimes.",
          "and it is a proposal that i will make.",
          "he knows that the only way to overcome it is to defeat the causes that generate it.",
          "we have chosen to be different from you, alternative to you.",
          "the sacrifices you make are obviously not an easy thing.",
          "we talk about all this, we look for our proposals, we do things, we question ourselves, we compare ourselves, etc.",
          "we are a whim of history and politics.",
          "and this seems to me to be one of those cases.",
          "this is also a very delicate, very important matter, on which i have found ears that are, let's say, willing, obviously to listen.",
          "we want to start again from respect for the dignity, the uniqueness and sacredness of every single human being, because each of us has a unique and unrepeatable genetic code.",
          "but obviously this doesn't mean that the topic isn't close to our hearts.",
          "but in my opinion the question must be addressed with this vision.",
          "well, i think it's important.",
          "we are flesh, blood, passions, something that comes from afar and that will go on again.",
          "but what is different?",
          "and it seems to me that on the other side there were people who wanted to listen.",
          "he must do it conscientiously.",
          "we are made of another stuff.",
          "we are history and political culture, we are ideas and their realization, we are the past that serves the future.",
          "i believe that this is the most effective model, which is what we intend to follow.",
          "it is a dimension of sacrifices that are made together for those who have done it before us and for us to do it towards others.",
          "and and so i really tell you, let's say from the heart and we can be curious about the people that we have here and the results that we get very.",
          "our job is to ensure immediate answers, the reason i wanted to come here today and you'll excuse me if there was suspense about where i had to go.",
          "it seems to me that even from the let's say personal human point of view, a very frank, very positive interlocution has been created.",
          "but it doesn't seem to me that the situation is what is described, perhaps even in a well-constructed communication campaign.",
          "we are the autonomous, free right, capable of building its own proposal that is different from that of everyone else, but which everyone else will have to deal with.",
          "let's see if we can make ourselves understood.",
          "and our history and our identity and our culture.",
          "if in these first months we were obviously, how can i say it, in a centrifuge, no, that is, we took over the government at a very particular moment.",
          "it is a measure that obviously impacts state coffers today, because where there is a creditor there is also a debtor and that debtor is the italian taxpayers.",
          "this means that obviously those who have cash to spend, perhaps foreigners, prefer to go and do it in other countries, because it cannot be done in italy.. then on the topic of tax evasion this too is unfortunately tragically contradicted by the numbers.",
          "so the government can only move forward if we increase house taxation and italy can afford an increase in house taxation while bills are already increasing.",
          "think about the effect that something like this has on hundreds and thousands of companies in italy, forcing employees to lose their jobs, to go on layoffs which means earning less on salaries that have already been lowered by inflation.",
          "this is why Brothers of Italy proposes a copernican revolution in the relations between the state and businesses.",
          "i've also heard it said but these poor kids can no longer have fun in italy they will have to go abroad so look, i'll read you a message that i received today from a common citizen who says it's not that you can't do rap of course you can open your vat number, rent or buy the place, hire a company that takes care of your security, hire legal staff.",
          "i believe that creating the conditions, to improve the quality of work in italy is a matter that concerns above all, like many other matters, the issue of economic growth, that is, above all we must put people in a position to hire.",
          "the example of germany is given, the example of france is given, but they are nations that have grown by more than twenty percent in the last twenty years, italy has grown by two percent, as we thought that our wages could grow adequately if the economy wasn't growing, the two things are inevitably linked.",
          "indeed, italy is even the only country in the european union that has decreasing wages and if we narrow the field to the last ten years, those in which the left has governed almost continuously, we will see that wages in this period have fallen on average of one point four percent.",
          "obviously intervening to tackle the phenomenon of poor labor is inevitably one of the priorities on which this government works, because, as the questioners the honorable, schlein and others point out, italy is the only oecd country in which from ninety to two thousand and twenty the average annual salary has decreased, while in the rest of the west it was growing.",
          "that is, we are illiberal and we cannot govern because we do not want to tax houses and we are illiberal because we think that a company which respects the rules given to it by the italian state after having invested cannot be expropriated to do a favor to the usual suspects of great strong powers.",
          "i think there is some possibility and then there are certainly differences between region and region.",
          "and the questioners of the democratic party also point out, i must say with a sincerity that does them credit, that in italy in recent years the share of gross domestic product that has been allocated to wages and salaries has decreased more than in the rest of the other industrialized states.",
          "but there is a problem that when the state does something it is never free, because the money it spends is taxpayers' money and therefore when it spends money it puts it on one side and takes it away from the other.. do you know how much it cost for every single italian, around two thousand euros, just under two thousand euros?",
          "if we looked at the oecd data on the trend of average wages, we would realize that for over thirty years the salaries of italians in real terms have been practically frozen.",
          "it's true, it's true, there is a problem: those who have governed until now have unfortunately made italian workers poorer.",
          "so yes, in italy there is a serious problem of low wage levels.",
          "it is not normal that different social safety nets still exist in italy between employees and self-employed workers.",
          "well, now the italians are also expecting an intervention on wages and this is one of our priorities, we have already started with the money it cost to cut excise duties for four months.",
          "that is, the paradox in italy today is that a twenty-year-old boy in excellent health who could work can earn up to seven hundred and eighty euros.",
          "and i believe it was due, further support to an economy which, even in a moment of difficulty, is giving us great satisfaction with growth, the italian one, estimated for the next few months to be higher than that of other european nations.",
          "which means that it doesn't depend on the, the, how much they pay you per hour of work you can be above nine euros and still be considered a poor worker then a slightly more complex matter than how it is addressed in some cases, but it is a matter that must be addressed because it is a problem that italy has without prejudice.",
          "so let's start from this assumption in the italian legal system there have always been measures that allowed renovation and energy efficiency works to be deducted from taxes.",
          "and brothers of italy, i think that a tax system should be added to this that rewards companies that create jobs in italy over those that don't..",
          "but anyone arriving from outside the european union before opening the shutter will have to present a surety to guarantee the payment of taxes, so that everyone can compete on equal terms.. we will restore dignity and freedom to the honest people who create work and wealth in italy.",
          "i'm not the one saying it and so there's something that doesn't add up when the prime minister comes to the chamber again yesterday and responding to a question time from the brothers of italy says taxes won't increase because you wrote it, you're doing it to increase taxes.",
          "precisely on the employment front there is some good news, the latest bank of italy report, ministry of labor anpal tells us that between january and february two thousand and twenty-three, that is, january and february of this year, despite the difficult moment that europe and obviously italy face, there are over one hundred thousand new jobs have been created in italy, an increase more than double that of the first two months of the previous year and about a third greater than the same months of 2019, i.e.",
          "and we hope that we can arrive at a serious, shared response to this, but one that improves the condition of italian workers overall and does not improve the condition of some, while worsening that of others.",
          "the main problem that has impacted italian families this year has been inflation and it is an issue to which the government has dedicated various measures since the beginning of its mandate.",
          "and i also told my interlocutors that the problem why our wages are lower than the european average is that our growth has been lower than the european average.",

          "after that, there is certainly an intervention that needs to be done with regards to the motorway network, where sometimes the price is can be significantly higher by virtue of the concessions, because sometimes in service stations the motorway manager gives a sub concession and in this passage sometimes some rules are skipped and therefore i think that on this too we need to make the concessionaires responsible for future concessions to monitor what happens.",

          "she regretted not having cut fuel excise duties.",
          "because first of all i hear about petrol costing two and a half euros and petrol is at an average of one euro point eight point second in the Brothers of Italy program it doesn't say that we would cut excise duties and i never talked about cutting excise duties as a priority in this election campaign.",
          "in the event that you do not comply with these requirements and we want to do, we have done something even more important and that is established that in each petrol station, in addition to the obligation to display the price at the pump of that petrol station, there is also the average daily price.",
          "the decrease in the cost of energy is favoring production, encouraging companies to start hiring again and it was therefore certainly the right choice to continue the battle for the introduction of a european ceiling on the price of gas",
          "what did we do first of all i wrote to the president of the antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and i asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, i spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes.",
          "and beyond this, the price of energy must be immediately disconnected from the price of gas.",

          "let's talk about what meloni says about work, about cutting the tax wedge, about economic interventions, let's discuss real politics, not stereotypes.",
          "i have never heard it said that we will be a problem for the meloni government.",

          "meloni eight years ago said she agreed with the ius co while contesting the ius soli and then brothers of italy.",
          "and a serious government, in my opinion this must do because i heard meloni runs away, meloni doesn't go, meloni disappears, meloni is not interested.",
          "let's talk about the issues that meloni raises.",
          "because i don't know if the issue is to necessarily insult giorgia meloni and let's say demonstrate in this way that you don't have many arguments or if the issue is that the democratic party really believes the things it is saying and writing, in which case they are let's say much worse than what we believed then.",
          "the nazis are already there, are the nazis surrounding meloni?",
          "that is, i even realized the law because i am a person who likes to read that in the democratic party's electoral program for the next five years of the democratic party they talk about me and it says giorgia meloni, that is, if i decide to stop to do politics they don't have a program, they don't know what to do.",

          "frankly, among other things, it wouldn't make sense on such an important measure.",
          "we believe that it is very important to bring young people closer to culture, so much so that in parallel to what minister san giuliano already has, the minister of culture is working on a culture charter by doing, let's say, a job with all the operators of the sector to promote cultural content, for young people, to give them further opportunities.",

          "but i also want to tell you that the issue of so-called relocations is secondary in the very complex situation we are facing.",
          "or will we continue to imagine solutions which unfortunately will not solve the bulk of the problem, which is the reason why we have started working mainly on growth.",
          "i think that no one should be spared because this is not a phase that can be taken lightly.",
          "because allow me, gentlemen, a nation in which there are two states of emergency at the same time is grotesque, especially if it is a democracy.",

          "also for this reason, from 2000 to 2019, italy grew less than anyone else in europe, only four percent, in the same period in which france and germany grew by more than twenty percent..",
          "in times of globalization, italy cannot set itself the objective of competing on the quantity of what it produces, but there is one thing on which the rest of the world does not compete.. with italy being the quality of what we produce, the brand is the most precious thing we have.",

          "that italy is not afraid.",
          "because not only because we want a culture that is clearly usable, but above all to remember that wine is not just an economic fact for us, it is above all an identity fact, it is above all a cultural fact.",
          "from the decree to protect strategic production sectors to the birth of the committee for made in italy, passing through the battle that allowed us to avoid the exclusion of wine, red meat and cured meats from european funding for the promotion of agricultural products, we have reiterated that italy intends to defend its infrastructure, its brand, its excellence from the two billion euros that we have allocated to interventions for the safety, adaptation and redevelopment of schools, of which seven hundred and ten million that we have released and one billion and two hundred million added from scratch until resources are increased to make universities more efficient for a total of one billion four hundred million.",
          "on an economic level we must remember that the wine sector in italy is worth over thirty billion euros, which employs over eight hundred and seventy thousand workers, first in the trade balance of our, of our made in and therefore obviously it is in our interest our duty, to support this world, also supporting it with generational change.",
          "from the undertaking with him, italy learned that it should never have limits imposed on it.",

          "first of all because many probably expected a little italy, spaghetti and mandolin which, when faced with difficulties, always turns the other way in the end and instead we have been something else, we are something else and look at this, it's not just a fact of pride is a matter of defense of the national interest, because when you are authoritative, when you are credible your voice is also listened to and when your voice is listened to then yes you can obtain results for your national interest.",
          "demonstrate the pride that we demonstrate because it will be that pride that will lead us to the leadership of this nation together with the millions of people who you wanted defeated and who didn't give up and who waited and fought so that their ideas could come to the leadership of this nation.",

          "yesterday in the council of ministers, minister schillaci made a report on the issue of covid, new cases and the surge in cases in china.",
          "it was the green pass and we contested it and it was made by a left-wing government okay or in any case where there were those who today contest this stuff here, as far as we are concerned, the only principle we want to affirm is that obviously italian welfare must be distinguished and concentrated on those who cannot work, because those who can work should work.",
          "thanks to the government's latest measure there will be more police officers in almost two hundred hospitals and it is obviously the very first part of an overall reform that we want to carry out on healthcare so that citizens can trust italian public hospitals again",

          "if you don't have the green pass, then we had a virus that came from china, but we don't want to import the chinese model.",
          "if you want to make a law that recognizes citizenship, let's say on the basis of the education of the citizen through the school system, i point out that compulsory schooling is ten years and instead the law that it was approved by the left and provides for five years and that is, it provides for something completely different which in fact is closer to the ius soli than to the ius scuola.",
          "first point, according to the italian government, the green pass could remain in force until january 2025.",
          "a decree from the president of the council of ministers is launched, therefore without parliamentary debate, to extend the green pass by eighteen months, which can be further extended by another eighteen now.",
          "having told people that they can enter a supermarket without a green pass to buy basic necessities and who will look at them at the cashier, we told twelve-year-olds that they were not vaccinated.",
          "it being understood that the vaccine is very useful not on contagion, but on, let's say on the disease, the worsening of the disease.",
          "okay, the green pass is perfect so we're not talking about the vaccine.",
          "the issue could have been addressed in another way and i mean more, the same scheme could have been used in all public offices, with clearly productivity that would have increased and in companies instead of preventing those who do not have the green pass the booster of being able to earn a salary to feed your children.",
          "it was the first days of january 2021 when Brothers of Italy proposed for the first time to the italian government to address the issue of fighting covid contagion, in particular within schools with controlled mechanical ventilation devices.",
          "because if i am not covered by the vaccine, in the months in which there is the green pass what is the green pass a way to allow people to possibly spread covid freely or what brothers of italy has always supported something which has no scientific evidence, which only serves to control citizens, to limit their freedom, the right to work, the possibility of playing sports, the possibility of socializing, the possibility of buying what i want at the supermarket, because here they also tell you that in the supermarket you can buy what they say.",
          "because if it is true that the vaccine is valid, let's say it gives you coverage for about six months, it means that eighteen months plus another eighteen months we also have to do a fourth fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth dose.",
          "what purpose do i need the green pass?",
          "yet it is estimated that every year around eighty thousand cats and fifty thousand dogs are abandoned, more than eighty percent of which risk dying from accidents or starvation.. pets are part of the family in every respect and Brothers of Italy intends to fight to guarantee them a dignified and loving life among our initiatives already launched in this legislature.",
          "what are you doing?",
          "no, they're used to being with family,",
          "you are four kilometers away.",
          "we want to fight to stop the illegal trafficking of approximately three hundred thousand puppies that arrive from eastern europe and are sold in italy every year for thousands of euros as purebred dogs, after having undergone endless days of travel in pitiful conditions.. and then we want to expand pet therapy activities and where possible we will let our animal friends enter nursing homes and hospitals, because even the company of those who love us is therapy.",
          "this interests me.",
          "for what putting on nail polish for what?",
          "maybe here, four thousand kilometers, maybe something further away from home.",
          "and because i really think that, as gandhi said, civilization of a people is measured by the way they treat animals.",
          "but even more important will be the information and training campaigns on respect for animals which must be carried out starting from schools.",
          "there is, for example, the tightening of penalties for those who mistreat, poison and abandon animals.",
          "fire extinguishers",
          "you know that there are almost twenty million dogs and cats that live in our homes as four-legged family members.",

          "anyone who turns to an employment center or employment agency must be immediately directed to a training course that has strong prospects of rapid hiring once the training course is finished.",
          "by reference contracts that are signed by the unions.",
          "but those who can work are instead included in a job training course, with a reimbursement of expenses during the training period and with important incentives for those who hire them.",
          "so there are still options for those who clearly want to get busy who sign up to the platform, provided they haven't found a job in the meantime, because in all this there is a fact that struck me and that i want to share with you.",
          "in this way, self-employed people who lose their jobs are protected and undeclared work is discouraged, always on the side of those who work, in whatever form they do so.",
          "because the truth is that the only way to fight poverty is to allow those in a difficult condition to improve that condition.",
          "what do you plan to do for employees?",
          "it can be done by having the state pay a portion of the social security contributions that are currently paid by the company and the worker under certain conditions.",
          "after that, this story that is making the rounds makes me particularly laugh, so on this document notes for a conservative program practically this sentence is written, namely that young people will no longer be able to choose whether to work or not, but will be bound to accepting a job proposal for the loss of any benefit which has become a thing for which you, in short the jobs you have to do forced labor.",
          "a virtuous mechanism that can push companies to hire this means fewer unemployed people paid for by the state and it means new taxpayers who pay taxes because the most formidable, but also the most dignified citizen's income that can be given to those who are able to work and the salary that arrives every month thanks to the work that has been done.",
          "we distinguish those who can work from those who cannot.",
          "those who are able to work must be trained and must be able to respond to job requests coming from companies.",
          "it is yet another proof of the fact that we were right when we said that the resources for active policies should be used, used to help companies hire.",
          "a hiring incentive, i.e.",
          "for those who hire women or young people up to thirty-six years old or recipients of citizenship income.",
          "and finally we deal with the work of people with disabilities, supporting the bodies that accompany them and allocating resources to encourage their hiring.",
          "a just state does not put those who can work and those who cannot on the same level of welfare because if it does so with limited resources it ends up hitting the weakest.",
          "this is why we believe that a just state does not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level.",
          "but for the state to be able to take care of those in need because they have no alternatives, people need to work if instead we all think we can stay there with the state that will give us a solution.",
          "because a state that tells you to stay at home, i don't need you, is not a state that is educating you.",
          "this makes a just state.",
          "this is not the case because it is not the state that generates work.",
          "we have always maintained that a just state should not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level of assistance, that the two things are very different and that a just state should ensure security in terms of assistance for those who are not able to work?",
          "so we have always said that it is a fair state that the citizen's income was the wrong measure, because a fair state does not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level of assistance..",
          "i don't want to leave his behind, but for the state not to leave anyone behind, it must be fair, a fair state does not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level as welfare because it ends up discriminating against the weakest.",
          "the state does not create wealth and jobs, it is businesses and workers who do it.",
          "it's time for the state to regain its prerogatives and return to doing what citizens pay taxes for.",
          "what does a just state do, a just state provides decent assistance for those who are not able to work and takes care of those who are not able to work, but for those who can work.",
          "what the state can do, however, is establish rules that favor those who create that wealth and those jobs.",
          "no, i don't think so, the right to work.",
          "so what do the right states do?",
          "disabled people, elderly people, families without income, with dependent minors, but that for everyone else, for those who can work, a fair state should create the conditions for having work.",
          "i am very pleased that the negotiations of film co-production agreements between japan and italy have reached my firm intention.",
          "no, we always celebrate what's wrong with this nation.",
          "i'm happy with how this day, how this day went, in which obviously i discussed, brought the italian point of view on some of the biggest issues we face.",
          "i want to reiterate my congratulations, italy's congratulations to the prime minister modi for the success of this difficult edition of the g20",

          "and i also thank matteo and antonio who wanted to be here this morning, our two deputy prime ministers.",
          "we didn't win the war, we didn't defeat the mafia, but this battle was a fundamental battle to win and it's a hard blow for organized crime.. and i also want to say that it is a day of celebration for me who began the adventure that leads me to the presidency of the council of ministers from the rubble of via d'amelio.",
          "i want to thank the minister of food sovereignty, francesco lollobrigida, because the ministry of food sovereignty has activated a further initiative.",

          "it is a day of celebration for us who can tell our children that the mafia can be beaten.",
          "well, it won't be an adventure, it's not a fire, it's not a fire that can die with the wind.",
          "so it will be a long and certainly very fascinating day.",
          "our day was very long.",
          "this adventure will be long, difficult, long.",
          "well, a dutiful presence, not the first.",
          "every day we collected them all and there were more.",
          "hopefully difficult, for sure.",
          "they will be very complex days.",
          "since our first meeting last november, i have never stopped asking the question.",
          "then obviously, in short, this is a first meeting.",
          "hopefully also exciting.",
          "yes, it will be i know.",
          "your first.",
          "and here too, throughout the national territory, we have begun to do what had not been done before, that is, we have begun to proceed with the evictions of illegally occupied houses..",
          "we will pass a law that will say one very simple thing: the first house cannot be seized, except obviously for non-payment of any mortgage loan that weighs on it.",
          "no one will have to fear illegal occupations anymore.",
          "this is also work that we intend to carry forward, continue to carry forward in the coming weeks because the era in which the state turns the other way in the face of crime and those who do not respect the rules is over.. public housing buildings should go to those in need, not to the families of criminals.",
          "you and i had a long chat last week and obviously we will do everything we need to do to help the population and then there is the issue of securing the territory.",
          "i heard that we want to ban demonstrations.",
          "what happens if these rules are not respected?",
          "it's time for citizens to take back their cities.",
          "we will no longer allow the game of open and close.",
          "and we will also approve another law that will say something else that is equally simple and sacrosanct: immediate eviction for illegal occupations of other people's homes, without exceptions, without stratagems.",
          "we will increase the resources and equipment of the police forces, we will relaunch and strengthen the operation, safe streets, we will increase video surveillance where necessary, we will redevelop the suburbs, especially the most degraded ones, because from the redemption of those areas and the people who live there well-being and safety also pass through and therefore we will encourage the opening of businesses in those areas, especially in the evening hours.",
          "we will break down unfair competition with this proposal that we have made for many years and no one has ever wanted to, has ever wanted to transform it into a law.",
          "we will protect the house from foreclosures, illegal construction and also from assets disguised by the left",
          "i see a change in mentality, but i still don't see concrete answers.",

          "clearly i aim to arrive at a proposal in time for the budget law, but i wouldn't want it to be simply a proposal from the majority as opposed to that of the opposition.",
          "that fun part ends here.",
          "to me it seems like a sign of attention and respect, of respect.",
          "how we never betrayed her, ever.",
          "of course, to all the embassy officials thanks to security.",
          "because he is putting up barricades against the cadastre reform that we have had since a decades-old cadastre.",
          "in the year two thousand and twenty-two on the twenty-second day of the month of october in rome, in the quirinale palace, in the hands of the president of the republic pursuant to article ninety-three of the constitution, the honorable giorgia meloni, president of the council of ministers, takes the oath.",
          "okay, the president of Brothers of Italy and the european conservative and reformist party, giorgia meloni",
          "however, the word transition itself presupposes a path that must be done gradually and with realism.",
          "honorable magi, you should know that i am not a person who is intimidated.",
          "but what happens today you will remember all your life.",
          "now, since you understand that i have the book, i wrote it and therefore i will know something about what i said and this allow me to say that it is let's say the classic example of idiocy.",
          "this too",
          "and even more i think we must be satisfied with the result regarding the issue of immigration on the immigration issue.",
          "honorable magi, you should know very well.",
          "i'm sorry, don't stop us.",
          "on may 1st, labor day, give signals on the topic of the world of work.",
          "we chose to do a difficult campaign because those themes were complex, they were more difficult to localize.",
          "but did you consider the opportunity of going for a visit to crotone because the mayor was also talking about this?",
          "it is a reactionary, backward right, an obscurantist right, a right that does not sufficiently focus on europeanism, a right that cannot lead a country that is a founding country of the european union.",
          "and those public budgets are the state budget, but they are also the budgets of local authorities.",
          "as you know, in europe we have had strong inflation caused by factors external to our economy, but the response of the european central bank was to intervene.",
          "he allowed himself to have this lack of respect.",
          "everyone in rome is organizing it at meloni's, we have nothing, we just have to steal.",
          "in this year and more in which we have continued to make this proposal to the government, the proposal has never been implemented.",
          "we are not willing to do this.",
          "the bulk of his measures are those who defend poor work as i hear some political exponents say and who instead has led to the inadequate wages we have today are friends of the workers because now that he is in opposition he is proposing the minimum wage?",
          "it is not even these that prevent those who do not think like them from speaking.",
          "someone already has some conspiracy theories.",
          "but look, it's the story of all the great mafia fugitives,",
          "no, sorry, but he's schizophrenic.",
          "i expect you to give substance to this very serious accusation.",
          "if this is the plan, i'll stay abroad, thanks.",
          "good evening and happy amadeus with your business.",
          "we know what poverty is and for this reason we say that the citizen's income is a wrong measure because it puts on the same level those who can work and those who cannot, those who need assistance and those who need a job.",
          "to try, while we're at it, to criminalize the only opposition to the current government, they even went so far as to use my daughter to attack me because these people have no scruples in a scruple because they are in disarray.",
          "that is, we cannot uncritically support a process that on the altar of decarbonization leads us straight to deindustrialization.",
          "i mean, what am i with the time zone?",
          "i met them on women's day and i was breathless by their courage, their strength, their dignity.",
          "we have decided what our priorities were.",
          "i think that we need to simply divide assistance from work if i give the same money that i give to a person who can work today to the company that hires him, i make him work, i create wealth, i invest okay, so there's no need to be afraid.",
          "we never fully realize it, probably because we are paradoxically addicted, not to the beauty and culture in which we are immersed.",
          "we do not want in any way to continue to favor human traffickers.",
          "rich individuals in expensive suits say it, professors who have never left the good neighborhoods of big cities.",
          "we confirm and indeed improve the support for those who cannot work, that is, for families in difficulty who have a minor, an elderly person or a disabled person within them.",
          "so it is a sign of attention on a subject that is close to my heart.",
          "i just want to say one thing that is related to what was said before me.",
          "in reality we don't want to abolish it.",
          "so combative because in the government documents it doesn't say what mario draghi says, it says the exact opposite and therefore there is a problem because either mario draghi doesn't read the documents that his government writes and i doubt it or on this is not telling the whole truth, because you see in the report that the government makes on this matter it is written verbatim that this provision, i.e.",
          "the government has remained faithful to its commitments.",
          "for me now the priority is to confirm those measures for the whole of 2024, to see if we can do something more clearly for low incomes, for the pensioners most in difficulty, from the beginning we made the choice to concentrate the few resources on those who were more in difficulty, but at work, because this is also a cultural and multiplier signal that must be given.",
          "in short, it seems to me that it cannot be said that like everyone else i have not done my best to do my job, as is right and normal because my job is to try to solve problems and it is that resignation of plants tosi opposition asks for the resignation of a different minister every day, so you understand that it is no longer much news.",
          "we won and i am happy that precisely in lucca as in gorizia, in pistoia, l'aquila and in many other cities that the centre-right won, in which it reconfirmed the brother mayors of italy, it drove the coalition.",
          "the paradox is italy and so maybe it's worth it, right?",
          "the state can create the conditions to favor those who generate work, because companies create work, with their capacity.",
          "good day",
          "it is an analysis that i share, because it is profoundly wrong to think that to welcome others one must deny one's own identity, including religious identity.",
          "look, we can make progress on immigration, it seems to me that progress has already been made.",
          "and a little, perhaps also because these people knew that at a certain point they would no longer be able to count on the income and so perhaps they rolled up their sleeves and started looking for a job which they found fourth, but it was said that if the income ends in august and the support tool starts in september for a month, these people are left with nothing.",
          "of course, but look at it there, no, okay she's italy expatriation.",
          "it means being used by the human trafficking of the third millennium and continuing to make billions of euros to the unscrupulous smugglers that we have known in recent years and that the italian government wants to fight",
          "and we have decided to introduce harsher penalties for those who attack healthcare workers.",
          "so now let's try the chiwa again.",
          "good morning.",
          "around twenty-five thousand people, but also in campania around one hundred and eight thousand new hires are expected and therefore there seems to be some possibility of finding employment.",
          "thank you president, thank you.",
          "freedom is a founding value of our italian, european and western identity, which not only cannot we forget, but which it is our task and duty to celebrate every day, starting from the anniversary of november 9th, with this spirit that the law establishing the day of freedom provides for the organization of commemorative ceremonies and moments of study in schools that illustrate the value of democracy and freedom, highlighting the harmful effects of past and present totalitarianism.",
          "ambassador, this is for you, it is the coat of arms of palazzo chigi where i am, in short, in a more welcoming house than yours.",
          "but this is a job that in the end you build day by day, more than politics, more than that, obviously.",
          "so i met with the opposition to tell them that it is a matter on which the government is absolutely available.",
          "the government has made all the means at its disposal available to support the work of the regions.",
          "except that we say we are not made like that, we are not people who would say we hate five star hotels.",
          "today the marche region presented, together with the yume foundation, the results of that initiative to professor luca ricolfi.",
          "the government will do its part this year, but i would like you to believe with us, to believe with me in the possibility of reviving this nation, of putting it back on its feet, of making it move quickly with enthusiasm, because we can do much more , we must do it together and therefore i wish you and your families great wishes for this year two thousand and twenty-three and i want to particularly thank yours truly his holiness pope francis for the wishes he addressed to the government on a particular day which is the first of the year and to a few hours since the passing of another great pontiff, benedict xvi, a giant of faith and reason who will be missed by everyone, you and your families.",
          "legislative objective.",
          "after that, in my opinion, the next step is to provide answers, no, to continue to work on the answers for which i already say a few days ago i had, speaking with minister piante dosi, with the undersecretary of mantua, discussed the possibility of bringing together the council of ministers the next opportunity to give a sign of further attention certainly, but also of concreteness with respect to the steps that still need to be taken, here too i have heard meloni is silent on this matter.",
          "and maybe you can't take leave because you can't make it with thirty percent pay in this context.",
          "so in any case even during that period you have coverage and this is obviously accompanied by real support measures for companies that hire from cutting the tax wedge to advantageous taxation with the formula that we call the more you hire, the less you pay.",
          "now the national collective agreement is a contract that has all the guarantees.",
          "but it is a nation that equally needs such a government, a government of free people, a government of people who have no masters, a government of people who cannot be blackmailed, a government of people who cannot be bought , of go, of a government made up of people who do not respond to a system of power.",
          "i called el line to personally congratulate her.",
          "from the presentation of the national plan for adaptation to climate change to the four hundred million that we have allocated for roads in the earthquake-stricken areas, passing through the additional resources in favor of the areas affected by meteorological events, we immediately put in place responses for the victims of events such as avalanches or earthquakes.",
          "i thought this lesson in quotes had done it",
          "so we are already working on the budget law.",
          "there is a right that is reliable, credible, capable of governing, perfectly presentable and which achieves results that others have not achieved.",
          "in tuscany, for example, over one hundred thousand hirings are planned and there are only three thousand people who stop receiving their income.",
          "the theme is to respect all those who to organize a rave, an evening in the disco to work, to live in a normal nation respect the laws of the italian state.",
          "thank you president, we will continue the conversation door to door thanks to you.",
          "how does he offend you?",
          "viva!",
          "because the reality we live in is making things difficult.",
          "",
          "good morning everyone!",
          "i really want to thank the prefect here, the deputy minister bignami, minister salvini came to work a few days ago in the last few hours.",
          "after that you need to put the filling.",
          "and i understand.",
          "this is written in giorgia meloni's book for those who don't want to make propaganda and for those who are interested in talking about serious issues without having to hit someone just because they dislike them.",
          "but that's not enough, we need to talk.",
          "i wanted to ask you, in the past you have been very critical of the plans adopted by past executives on the containment of the epidemic and you feel that you can exclude that italy, in the event of a new critical situation, will return to the restriction of lockdowns at vaccination obligation at the green pass.",
          "nothing is blocked anywhere, because in democracies, in national states it works that there is a bureaucracy that there is a government that remains in office until the next government takes office.",
          "hi.",
          "the right state must help you find a job because work produces a possibility of improving your condition, whereas if i always keep you in the same condition.",
          "your leu allies give me shivers what they say about justice, those of the five star movement.",
          "for them there are only those who would like to work and those who would like to work should be beaten, but who instead commits crimes?",
          "but that image is also there.",
          "we brought home an excellent result here the moment.",
          "gentlemen, it doesn't work like that.",
          "i believe it is effective to cut taxes on labor, because the reason why wages are inadequate is that taxation is too high for the companies that have to hire them and work to combat discrimination and irregularities.",
          "laura boldrini it is let's say, a modern enough right to be able to govern by expressing giorgia meloni, prime minister no, soon we will see the messages, we will see the polls which in any case already anticipate you, they give brothers of italy this first italian party.",
          "and so we have to thank you.",
          "but it is true that diplomacy is lacking from this point of view and is lacking for the credibility of western leadership.",
          "they stop receiving income, earners between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine who are not disabled do not have dependent minor children, or people who are perfectly capable of working according to.",
          "one hundred and ten for the future.",
          "you can't do it, but that family sees you.",
          "for now it's confirmed for me, of course.",
          "obviously at the institute of the house of culture thanks to brexit.",
          "i come from the gsette, as you know and independently of the gsette, where there was also great availability, great solidarity.",
          "we live in an economic and financial phase that is very complicated.",
          "we also do it to respect migrants, because if someone is risking their life they have the right to be saved.",
          "you must never stop studying because there is no greater freedom than that which knowledge gives you when you know when you know there is no one who can make fun of you, there is no one who can make fun of you.",
          "i want to wish all the mayors who were elected well in their work.",

          "because everything is seen as a certain narrative, everything is seen against us, but i absolutely do not consider it an initiative against us.",
          "you see, president, unlike most of the people who are here, we have never defended our privileges.",
          "i believe that obviously the government must continue to monitor what is happening and intervene when it is necessary to intervene, but i say with great sincerity that i am convinced of the choices we have made.",
          "and because on this yes, on this i and my opposition say we are completely in two different worlds, the state that harasses people who try to work respecting the rules and then pretend not to see those who respect these rules, if these rules don't give a damn, it's finished.",
          "isn't it the credibility that we have built today largely through politics?",
          "platform exhaling speculation even more than a day, president, what of race?",

          "and i think that those who are making conspiracy theories, let's say perhaps to attack the government, because the objective is always the topic of politics.",
          "and therefore when you ask another to defend you, you must know that that other rightly will not do it for free, the famous american interference that many, many complain about.",
          "it's not something that politics built, it's something that you built from the top.",
          "this is the difference between me and the left.",

          "the ideological armamentarium of the pd restarts.",
          "but look, if i had presented myself with a structured counter-proposal from the government it would have been said that i didn't want to allow the opposition to do theirs, just as when i proposed to make a comparison with in i was accused of wanting to make the opposition withdraw the proposal.",
          "in the meantime, what has the government done?",
          "instead, last week they didn't realize today that the monster is there, they also noticed the previous electoral campaign.",
          "and probably also this distrust which then made it difficult at times to move forward in solving strategic dossiers.",
          "our work is a work that will see the minister of health as one of the important points of reference, who has personified, in these two years, what our choices mean in favor of the safety of citizens in favor of a safety that has guaranteed freedom in favor of a security that guaranteed freedom.",
          "and do you know why friends of the pd, why they don't buy your nonsense anymore?",

          "it is not the first time that the government has dealt with this matter.",
          "then a couple of themes from the pd's electoral campaign in the last few hours are worth looking into further.",

          "this was something we knew when we appointed the government.",

          "yes, yes, because also from the world l g b t. yes, we must also dispel this prejudice that one must necessarily be a communist.",
          "and if politics wants to deprive us of something, well, it must first demonstrate to us that the benefit will be greater than the sacrifice.",
          "of course, if the left is really so convinced that it has won, then it will have no problem immediately returning to the political elections to confront.",
          "go ahead if you are capable and of people who perhaps weren't capable and who got to where they got to because they were left-wing.",
          "there have been so many of them in recent years that they are now afraid of competing in an open field.",
          "and it is also due to this political weakness of the left that we are in the situation we are in, because the left is incapable of reading reality, caught up as it is in its ideological delusions.",
          "however, there are some porro matters on which politics should take a back seat for a moment.",
          "look, i spent a few years in parliament.",
          "so we intervened and continue to intervene.",
          "after that, however, the left tells you that you are authoritarian for whatever it tells you that you are authoritarian.",
          "i believe that the center-right must reflect on the time that it has uselessly spent on internal controversies in these elections too.",
          "that is, we come from legislatures in which we were essentially told that work could be created by decree, that poverty could be eliminated by decree.",
          "others are interested in discrediting the nation in order to hope to gain a point - this is a fundamental difference between us and the left.",
          "obviously beyond the issue of respect for international law, the value of sovereignty and freedom of a nation.",
          "if anything, for the left it has often been a problem for us the comparison if it is a comparison made on ideas it is simply good news and therefore i am certainly ready for the comparison.",
          "the government's sign of attention towards people who find themselves facing a difficult situation.",
          "i have read delusional statements from half of the pd who are already preparing the next electoral campaign.",

          "it's not a political problem, so i don't see a political problem in it.",
          "above all, politics, a good part of politics, has been able to take advantage of your example.",

          "and then when the numbers are needed, the numbers must be there because otherwise the work of the majority will not work.",
          "in short, having been in parliament for a few years, i also know that when political signals have to be given, they are given on secondary things, they are not given on things that are objectively not, that is, this bad image for us, but not for us, only government, in short for everyone, so i really think it was superficiality that i can't say whether it's better or worse, but it's certainly something that can be remedied.",
          "i don't know what foreign leader of a foreign nation that isn't mine, which is exactly what everyone else does.",
          "liberals would not make this point.",
          "i mean, internal political issues, no, the fact of privileging one's internal public opinions.",
          "for those who follow these dynamics, you know that well, in the last five or six years,",
          "look, because i was in the opposition for many years and i don't remember ever being summoned by a prime minister on the basis of a proposal i had presented in parliament.",
          "we need to talk to each other immediately to stop the controversy, remembering that the opponent is always the left and never the allied party.",
          "if politics wants to ask for sacrifices, well, it must first demonstrate that it is willing to make them.",
          "what does it mean to seek visibility.",
          "something new has been added in recent weeks, namely that this government has started its own.",
          "but clearly woe betide anyone who isn't clear that the priority must be the good of the nation, no matter what the cost.",
          "i believe that a further evaluation needs to be made and we would say to focus particular attention on the parliamentarians on mission, that is, on those who have a double role.",
          "in short, we have taken the measures.",
          "are we also talking about a change of direction by the government here?",
          "in this paradoxical situation, it is clearly our task now, net of the incredible work that all our armed forces and law enforcement agencies have done.",
          "to be faithful to the republic, to loyally observe the constitution and the laws and to exercise my mandate and my functions in the exclusive interest of the nation.",
          "but there are moments in which privileging one's internal public opinion risks being to the detriment of the cause.",
          "a right that is not liberal is not liberal because a right is liberal, for example.",
          "and that's exactly what we're trying to do.",
          "the government is there, well, it's one of those situations in which all institutional levels need to work to the maximum of their possibilities and in short, i hope it can be seen that we are there",
          "because i really don't believe that there are matters on which one can, let's say, exaggerate in an attempt to criticize or let's say hit someone who evidently considers himself one of his adversaries, the president..",
          "but i repeat, politics doesn't do this or politics does it marginally and what politics does can only do because there are people who every day decide to sacrifice a little piece of themselves for this homeland, for this nation..",
          "and in fact for ten years now because the tweet that the left is spreading everywhere today from eight years ago we have been saying the same thing that we agree with the jus co.",
          "this is the difference between me and the left, is that clear?",
          "we decided to take stock of our work.",
          "you should remember that it is thanks to the policies you have made.",
          "are we defending something else?",
          "i believe that in short, everyone should be called to their responsibility, because here we face a situation that is not easy.",
          "and i'm happy that finally those who, when they were in government, were unable to reverse this trend are realizing it..",

          "it looks like a lancia y with the four position indicators lit that was trumpeting and trying to make its way through the intense city traffic.",
          "international law provides something very clear: you are obliged to save someone if you accidentally meet them and if someone is at risk.",
          "here too it is worth recounting some data in rome, here we are talking about ten apartments in the ater, therefore public residential buildings, that is, public housing which were partly occupied by criminal families..",
          "the causes are multiple, we obviously know the political instability, economic crises which are obviously aggravated by the international conflict and last but not least i continue to denounce the interests of powerful criminal trafficking organizations which often have transnational projections.",
          "it also means hitting the traffickers who are behind it.",
          "this is what i saw in the eyes of maria josef janata marcus, two very young nigerian christians, victims of the ferocity of the boko haram terrorists.",
          "you see, president, when there is a war it is the women and children who flee, the men tend to stay and fight.",
          "we were not warned that this vessel was in danger of sinking.",
          "regimes that had trampled on those fundamental values ​​and rights that have become a common heritage of western democracies and that we often mistakenly tend to take for granted today.",
          "what are the measures?",
          "except that that route is not covered by ngos and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "the decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",
          "the immigration issue.",
          "i mean, there are several companies that ask the government within the flow decree on immigration to let in some immigrants who they need to do jobs.",
          "no people, so how can i say angry so desperate in short so envious as to react with this hatred?",
          "and i say this because for years here we have been told that there was the tragedy of refugees faced with images of boats full of single men of working age.",
          "a few days ago i read the news of clashes between the forces of the libyan ministry and human traffickers.",
          "we dealt with immigration in the same council of ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of ngos which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "but refugees are not about welcoming a community, giving hospitality to a community that in italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules.",
          "the adolescence dot it site is a site that clearly deals with the phenomena of children's adolescence seen from a scientific point of view, so to speak, it explains the topic of youthful deviance better, saying in adolescence such behaviors can manifest themselves in ways which differ in persistence and severity from more oppositional attitudes, such as disobeying or lying, violation of laws, use and abuse of narcotic substances, vandalism and violence against the person.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "which first nations provide assistance?",
          "how does my culture offend you?",
          "first point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "what this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",
          "the immigration emergency, just as the nigerian mafia emergency never existed, just as the emergency of drug dealers who continued to camp out in the middle of the streets, even when italians were locked inside their homes, never existed.",
          "here are the rules that the italian government has brought forward that aim to limit the rescue of migrants to what is required by international law, with some fairly simple rules.",
          "preventing people from having fun as i have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",
          "we have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for ukraine to the mattei plan for africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",

          "mass immigration is a phenomenon of very wide scope, which obviously concerns the lives of migrants, which concerns the protection of the most vulnerable, but which also concerns the safety of citizens and the social protection of our societies.",
          "who are those who need protection?",
          "because it being understood that what we know is what you heard from undersecretary mantovani regarding this matter, these people, were not in a position to be saved by someone who did not want to save them, as unfortunately it seems to me that some people want to say.",
          "the images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",
          "it means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "for them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "except that that route is not covered by ngos and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",

          "clear information on rescue mechanisms is needed.",
          "i leaned out to look inside the vehicle and noticed a child in a let's say relaxed state of abandonment, who also at the desperation of the familiar gods i turned on both the acoustic and light signals.",
          "then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "what does this tool consist of?",
          "because among the many falsehoods that i have heard in recent hours there is the one according to which these people, let's say, were shipwrecked due to the government's measures on non-governmental organizations.",
          "which historically we say is easier for them to hide where they grew up.",
          "among the many falsehoods that i have heard in recent hours is the one according to which these people have been shipwrecked due to the government's measures on non-governmental organizations.",
          "widespread petty crime, violence, open-air drug dealing, baby gangs, streets, squares, sometimes entire neighborhoods completely abandoned to decay and removed from state control, often handed over to the putrid rules of the mafia and organized crime.",
          "in the specific case, for example, of cutro, in the event that people die during one of these crossings and attention, an element that i consider very important, the crime will be prosecuted by italy even if committed outside the national borders.",
          "now i wonder if there is really anyone in this nation who in good conscience believes that the government deliberately caused over sixty people to die, including some children?",
          "we are used to an italy that is mainly concerned with going in search of migrants throughout the mediterranean.",
          "firefights the people who organize the departures of illegal migrants towards italy go around armed and i don't want to help these people because i fight all the mafias.",
          "that is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",

          "it's mostly women.",
          "look partly yes, because some time ago we communicated to our european partners that we could no longer, let's say automatically welcome back the so-called dubliners, that is, irregular immigrants who arrive on italian territory and then move on to other nations.",
          "just what's the difference?",
          "we need rules to prevent that in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",

          "it was difficult to imagine that there was such awareness on this matter on the part of the european council.",
          "the only way to seriously deal with this matter with humanity is to stop the departures and on this we need a europe which, in addition to obviously declaring availability, acts quickly.",
          "the approach of the european council in the conclusions of the european council is very different from what we have seen in recent years..",
          "i think of the fact that we have had concrete references, for example to migration issues, in line with what is the rome process, our conference on development and migration with india, the united states, the european union, france, germany, arabia saudi, united emirates.",
          "if europe did not lend us a hand in defending the external borders, then in stopping the primary movements.",
          "i say this with a touch of pride, but above all i say it with great gratitude towards the european commission, the council of partners who have worked towards this objective.",
          "and this is the reason why i sent a letter to the european council and the european commission today to ask that what we discussed at the last meeting of the european council be immediately made concrete.",

          "for this reason, from a mutually beneficial partnership perspective, i believe that the first objective of this conference should be to launch development initiatives and projects for the wider mediterranean region of sub-saharan africa through the joint planning and implementation of initiatives and projects which from my point of view should focus mainly on the structural aspects of agriculture, energy, infrastructure, education and training, healthcare, water, hygiene.",
          "it's not true what is said and what is partly written in this document that we have to do it because europe asks us to, otherwise we won't get the p n r r money.",
          "immigration is a european problem and needs a european response.",
          "united states european union",
          "the question for me is not how we pass them on one side, as we say, we dump the problem from one side of europe to the other and the only way to solve it for everyone is to stop them and stop the primary movements, therefore the arrivals in italy.",
          "the approach that the european council, put in black and white yesterday, starts from a sentence that has never been managed to put in a document of this type.",
          "the only way to seriously deal with this matter with humanity is to stop the departures and on this we need a europe which, in addition to obviously declaring its availability, acts quickly.",
          "you have seen that for the first time the central mediterranean route, today considered a priority issue of european interest, was thanks to the impetus of this government.",
          "i want to be clear about one thing, what we are inaugurating today is above all a dialogue between equals based on mutual respect, because the relationship between europe and the wider mediterranean cannot be a relationship, let's say competitive, or even conflictual.. then i want to be the first to be frank.",
          "and it's not an imposition by the americans, it's a european choice and it's a wrong choice, because if we are convinced that clearly the destiny of the west as a whole is inextricably linked, well we are equally convinced that not always from one on the other side of the atlantic the interests are perfectly overlapping.",
          "we obviously talked about migratory flows and the let's say, italian request for let's say, let's say, a change in the point of view of the italian position, so for us the priority of becomes a priority that is already foreseen in the european regulations, which it is the defense of external borders.",
          "yesterday we launched a major economic corridor project between the european union, the middle east and india, a network of maritime and rail connections that will release, from my point of view, enormous potential for our trade and our businesses..",
          "we have always claimed the need for europe to deal more with the mediterranean front.",
          "when you go abroad your point of view changes immediately.",
          "a transition which, as we have always said and forcefully reiterated in europe, is indispensable, but must be done with criteria.",
          "europe's involvement is fundamental.",
          "i know that for many of you in the past, europe has not always considered the problems of the rest of the world as its own and that more generally the west has sometimes given the impression of being more attentive to giving lessons rather than giving a hand.",
          "after the tragedy of crotone, once again europe is tearing its clothes but not taking a step, while the opposition severely attacks the government's policy on migrants.",
          "it's missing because the president of the united states is inadequate, because europe doesn't exist and even italy doesn't seem to be giving a great account of itself..",
          "we have always talked about addressing the issue by defending the external borders of the european union and a european mission to block departures.",
          "why the drafts the draft conclusions if we look at the past on the topic of the external dimension, on the topic of the fact that the migration issue is a european issue on the topic of the specificity of the maritime border, which obviously needs different responses, it is a huge step ahead of the past.",
          "no, it would not be the barricades on the bolkestein, that is, which liberalizes the public concessions of the sea.",
          "obviously a lot of work needs to be done at european level.",
          "it is possible that we are able to do something that might be unthinkable even in europe.",
          "this, from my point of view, changes many things in the european approach to the migration issue.",
          "as you know, in recent weeks and at the last meeting of the european council, important steps forward have been made, to which concrete solutions must be given today, obviously in the shortest time possible.. and then, obviously, we talked about the resources of how to best spend the resources of the national recovery and resilience plan, as well as in the face of the difficulties that exist, increase in the costs of raw materials, inflation.",
          "for the first time in europe, meetings are held and documents emerge in which it is said that the central mediterranean route is a priority.",
          "and then you understand well that in this we are much more pro-european than many of the brussels thugs.",
          "it is thanks to the spiritual, political and diplomatic work of a saint and a statesman like john paul ii, who said that europe must breathe with two lungs, the western one and the eastern one.",
          "the very bad eastern countries, first of all poland and hungary, threatened, insulted for years by the european commission, by the left, by the mainstream media.",
          "it is better if it is done in agreement with all the eu states, but it can in any case also be done at a national level.",
          "before the pandemic arrived..",
          "it has never happened and therefore steps forward are being made at a european level and at a national level.",
          "having said this, and obviously i feel i can say that the def will be approved by parliament in the next few days and hours and that we will keep our commitments, including that of presenting it in europe by april 30th.",
          "so for this reason, as i said before, we intend to follow the path of technological neutrality and we are doing so firmly, but also with a proactive spirit at a european level.",
          "this means firmly combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, it means protecting those who have the right to international protection and managing legal immigration in an orderly manner through flow decrees.. all within a framework of responsibility that must also involve the other european states.",
