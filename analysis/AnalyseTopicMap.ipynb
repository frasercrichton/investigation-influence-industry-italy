All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture., match of E Times for showing can be free people and a supra nation security and international British moldova with food and time the witch show the on I club Europe is more and be and us from from witch depend from from Hades cast principal in Detroit from helping yn to shapes from your The Walk yn Moldova Georgian Western to the European Union A witch mins wedding European Union Coming Back to get York SE Europe S John Paul II The Pop Set West the Est and A in the the solution Security Account Witch The Energetic One The capacity from and remember Global Relations Africa the Migration HTS Nations to too]  \n",

       "10  [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days.]  \n",

All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]</td>\n",

Carron, Sanka Gesù, the president of Brothers of Italy left her parts preserved Italian Brothers of Italy and Draghi Brothers of Italy her parts and that the time and the deterioration, the the the the, the the the the the the surviving tragic, the Soviet Union for the misma bla of freedom, positioning of the current world and in what I don't know, we synergistically put in casts anti-democratic drift with palabras signatures that we don't always encounter if the group is Italian, European and even in the next one is the change represented for brothers of Italy, however, of Western freedom to maintain the farm during agnos and of garrisons the European conservative party which with the stories and American Israeli position in the Western field is crystal clear with the pink aggression against Ukraine, the contribute to bring if the Italian position in Europe and internationally our idea of ​​Europe and Slade is a political entity capable of representing an additional real value with less bureaucracy, the greats assumed that it shoots the future of Italy CSL dynamic and presides over the world that has contributed to large Europe.]  \n",

All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]  \n",

All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture., match of E Times for showing can be free people and a supra nation security and international British moldova with food and time the witch show the on I club Europe is more and be and us from from witch depend from from Hades cast principal in Detroit from helping yn to shapes from your The Walk yn Moldova Georgian Western to the European Union A witch mins wedding European Union Coming Back to get York SE Europe S John Paul II The Pop Set West the Est and A in the the solution Security Account Witch The Energetic One The capacity from and remember Global Relations Africa the Migration HTS Nations to too]  \n",

       "9   [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days.]  \n",

All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income., Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture., match of E Times for showing can be free people and a supra nation security and international British moldova with food and time the witch show the on I club Europe is more and be and us from from witch depend from from Hades cast principal in Detroit from helping yn to shapes from your The Walk yn Moldova Georgian Western to the European Union A witch mins wedding European Union Coming Back to get York SE Europe S John Paul II The Pop Set West the Est and A in the the solution Security Account Witch The Energetic One The capacity from and remember Global Relations Africa the Migration HTS Nations to too]  \n",

       "9   [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days.]  \n",

          "After that, in my opinion, the next step is to provide answers, no, to continue to work on the answers for which I already say a few days ago I had, speaking with Minister Piante Dosi, with the Undersecretary of Mantua, discussed the possibility of bringing together the Council of Ministers the next opportunity to give a sign of further attention certainly, but also of concreteness with respect to the steps that still need to be taken, here too I have heard Meloni is silent on this matter.",
          "No, I'm not someone who says one thing and thinks one.",
          "Thank you.",
          "They are the ones who write that they are reforming the land register to increase taxes on houses.",
          "Thank you very much.",
          "In reality we don't want to abolish it.",
          "I believe that what happened in China demonstrates this very well, so my idea is that we must work primarily on the responsibility of citizens rather than on coercion, as I said in the past, which in my opinion should be done and as I intend to do in the future.",
          "I mean, leaving aside the scandals, the scams, the missed checks that have filled the news every day related to the topic of citizen's income in these years in which this measure has been in place, what do we want to do?",
          "They were sacrificed to the incompetence of a political class who thought that a Chinese virus should be responded to with a Chinese model of society.",
          "And I tell you in good conscience that I think I can lead a government like this.",
          "From us they will have every possible support, as we have always demonstrated throughout our history.",
          "and I am proud to lead this nation.",
          "I ask Giuseppe to the President.",
          "Maybe it's not that easy.",
          "I am obviously here to bring greetings, thanks and best wishes.",
          "You know that you know it much better than me, because here you live in short how much this land we have given how much we have given in terms of sacrifices, how much we have also given in terms of blood tribute how much that sacrifice and that tribute also constructed, if we want, even at home.",
          "Italy has worked a lot in recent years, above all with the aim of representing more, how can I say, a limit rather than a stimulus to the creation of wealth.",
          "Because he is putting up barricades against the cadastre reform that we have had since a decades-old cadastre.",
          "In times of globalization, Italy cannot set itself the objective of competing on the quantity of what it produces, but there is one thing on which the rest of the world does not compete.. With Italy being the quality of what we produce, the brand is the most precious thing we have.",
          "Then, thank you.",
          "Yes, I consider this shameful.",
          "First of all, I heard that we raise money from the poor.",
          "And in short, I trust that I can count on the support of Parliament, which I think is a very significant signal.",
          "Once something got stuck in parliament.",
          "Don't you think there was a political signal?",
          "I am aware of the person I represent for what I have and I am focused on this, so there is not much to say about this.",
          "But today's Council of Ministers, with another decree, dealt with other very important matters, over two thousand new men in the personnel of the police, the Coast Guard, the Fire Brigade, that is, over two thousand people to strengthen the safety of citizens.",
          "You decide what your limits are.",
          "No, there isn't that much.",
          "And then measures to increase the incentives that lead researchers who have fled abroad to return to Italy.",
          "Okay, the president of Brothers of Italy and the European Conservative and Reformist Party, Giorgia Meloni",
          "And when the public budget collapses?",
          "Enough.",
          "And I return to the topic because you see, it's a fact.",
          "Viva!",
          "So the higher we climb and the more we bring with us what we come from, the more dreams we will have and the more it will be our responsibility to bring them to reality..",
          "I consider it shameful that Enrico Letta does an interview on c n n not to explain what he will do to the government of this nation, but to try to tell this nation abroad that if the center right wins the center right supported by more than half on paper of Italian citizens.",
          "Exact.",
          "Above all, director, as you know, the issue of employee employment was our priority.",
          "Since I am a serious person, I expect the same seriousness from those who want to flea me",
          "So what?",
          "What are they telling us?",
          "Let's try to think together.",
          "look, as you said, the general picture is quite complex.",
          "Because you see, when you tell millions of Italians that I am a danger, a dangerous person for history, a person who could paradoxically kill millions of people, invade a state or do things that the people with whom I am lumped together have done.",
          "It should also be remembered that obviously this world produces more than half of our productions or Ps, therefore our productions of excellence and therefore, let's say, the presence of the government could not be missing, which as you know, has been present at all levels in these days.",
          "And we hope that we can arrive at a serious, shared response to this, but one that improves the condition of Italian workers overall and does not improve the condition of some, while worsening that of others.",
          "Because the great objective that we have always given ourselves in life and that we have given ourselves as a political force, was to ensure that Italians could once again be proud of being Italian, of waving the tricolor flag",
          "An instability that penalizes us in relations with other states because it clearly makes us appear less credible.",
          "It was the green pass and we contested it and it was made by a left-wing government okay or in any case where there were those who today contest this stuff here, as far as we are concerned, the only principle we want to affirm is that obviously Italian welfare must be distinguished and concentrated on those who cannot work, because those who can work should work.",
          "Me too you too.",
          "What's the point?",
          "If this is the plan, I'll stay abroad, thanks.",
          "You will not return home, but your home is not far away.",
          "Italy is not afraid of young people who want not to have to escape from their land.",
          "Except that it is a proud Italy that does not change its position from one day to the next because as long as I am in government, this Italy I want to represent a woman at the helm of the Democratic Party.",
          "We are working on this thanks to the position of the Italian government.",
          "To seriously address this reflection, I think it is important to start from what has happened in Italy in recent decades, no.",
          "But obviously Italy continues to be fully committed to our contribution, the all-round contribution because we are aware of how we have said it several times?",
          "I'm happy that we're talking about p n r r because evidently we agree on the fact that in some cases you have to spend resources in the best possible way, even re-discussing if necessary, something that is less urgent.",
          "And here I heard a bit of everything.",
          "However, the word transition itself presupposes a path that must be done gradually and with realism.",
          "It deserves to be commented on because it's surreal from start to finish?",
          "In Italy you do not enter Italy illegally, you only enter legally.",
          "We are also doing it in these days of support in favor of the states of North Africa, Tunisia in the lead, because Tunisia is experiencing a profound crisis, with consequences that can be very worrying for Italy and not only do we want to be an impetus to all of Europe for a new relationship with Africa.",
          "The first measure ever taken by this government is the defense of obstructive prison, the defense of hard prison.",
          "I respect them.",
          "Enough, gentlemen.",
          "Our expert from his villa in Capalbio explains it to us.",
          "Good luck.",
          "So Italy must say thank you.",
          "We have demonstrated with facts that we care about this issue because everything we have done, the bulk of what we have done has been dedicated to this matter.",
          "Austria, which borders Italy, has no cash limit.",
          "And I think that those who are making conspiracy theories, let's say perhaps to attack the government, because the objective is always the topic of politics.",
          "So obviously this thing here needs to be sorted out because in the meantime there have been a lot of scams and this has been widely talked about to date with estimates of around nine billion euros worth of scams, that is, jobs that haven't been done, jobs that would have been facts about buildings that don't exist, that is, every kind of scam, obviously possible and imaginable.",
          "Are quite?",
          "And above all, the State can intervene immediately to allocate more resources to reduce the bills of families and businesses with direct aid and tax credits.",
          "But I tell you even if there was a proportional law with today's numbers, sorry Giletti, then we'll see when we go to vote, maybe brothers of Italy have five percent.",
          "On the twenty-fifth of September, Sunday from seven to twenty-three at the last vote to restore freedom to this nation, to restore its pride, to restore the greatness it deserves.",
          "Let me simply explain why?",
          "Almonst never.",

          "So in short, I trust that we do not have to modify, let's say the government's initiatives, even a fairly defined schedule that we also had on some provisions that depend on the Def, which for me are very significant, in particular in terms of work in the next days, with May 1st.",
          "We will pass a law that will say one very simple thing: the first house cannot be seized, except obviously for non-payment of any mortgage loan that weighs on it.",
          "Are we also talking about a change of direction by the government here?",
          "Look, the opposition does their job and obviously let's say it doesn't scare me.",

          "We need to talk to each other immediately to stop the controversy, remembering that the opponent is always the left and never the allied party.",
          "Others are interested in discrediting the nation in order to hope to gain a point - this is a fundamental difference between us and the left.",
          "But I repeat, politics doesn't do this or politics does it marginally and what politics does can only do because there are people who every day decide to sacrifice a little piece of themselves for this homeland, for this nation..",
          "Look, if you had asked me before the conflict in Ukraine I would have told you that I was absolutely certain that the government would go home before the end of the legislature.",
          "It's not something that politics built, it's something that you built from the top.",

          "They say because we didn't want to enter into the government's competences, let's say it seems a bit more like a game of craps to me, as if to say in our opinion it should be done, but then you see it for yourself, then serious things from this point of view are done with roofing.",
          "Instead, last week they didn't realize today that the monster is there, they also noticed the previous electoral campaign.",
          "I find that the electoral campaign that the left is running is an electoral campaign that betrays a great awareness of its own weakness.",
          "the center-right wins these administrative elections and confirms its consensus among Italians, its roots, its strength.",

          "Frankly, among other things, it wouldn't make sense on such an important measure.",
          "But it's ridiculous according to what you think, what do you fear from that political party?",
          "If anything, for the left it has often been a problem for us the comparison if it is a comparison made on ideas it is simply good news and therefore I am certainly ready for the comparison.",
          "And I'm happy that finally those who, when they were in government, were unable to reverse this trend are realizing it..",
          "We have decided to intervene with the only tool available to the government which is taxation.",
          "And we will also approve another law that will say something else that is equally simple and sacrosanct: immediate eviction for illegal occupations of other people's homes, without exceptions, without stratagems.",
          "I do it because I want to know if in this nation there is still the right not to be left-wing without risking becoming victims of the misfit on duty, because they taught him to hate you.",
          "Remember to check if you have the electoral card, if not you have to go and ask for it at the relevant municipality when you arrive and hand over these documents they will give you two cards, one yellow for the Senate of the Republic, one pink for the Chamber of Deputies.",
          "we are not satisfied with the outcome of these ballots.",
          "But there is one advantage: it's easy to vote, it's easy to vote, you shouldn't be wrong.",
          "What is the first measure of this Porro government?",
          "The center right certainly could have done better, but the overall data of the administrative elections, given that the PD is celebrating, forces us to bring Letta back to the planet.",
          "To try, while we're at it, to criminalize the only opposition to the current government, they even went so far as to use my daughter to attack me because these people have no scruples in a scruple because they are in disarray.",
          "it would have been easy in this electoral campaign to go as others did in the southern cities and promise money to everyone.",
          "And that's what the opposition is doing.",
          "And then we must expect a very tough electoral campaign, an electoral campaign that will heat up month after month.",
          "So until the twenty-fifth everyone concentrated on the twenty-fifth, let's go and vote and terrible electoral law.",
          "We have now made another decree which essentially does some other important things.",
          "We will protect the house from foreclosures, illegal construction and also from assets disguised by the left",
          "We are quite used to the fact that El Schlein, secretary of the Democratic Party, told those who complained because a minister had been prevented from presenting his book that we have a problem with dissent.",
          "In the meantime, what has the government done?",
          "platform exhaling speculation even more than a day, President, what of race?",
          "If politics wants to ask for sacrifices, well, it must first demonstrate that it is willing to make them.",
          "It seems to me that this government, from all points of view, is not giving a great account of itself, even, I mean, on the international issue.",
          "But while they will continue to try to pit citizens against each other and divert attention from their failures, from their incompetence, with these means we will not give respite.",
          "Have you failed in the administrative exams?",
          "We will break down unfair competition with this proposal that we have made for many years and no one has ever wanted to, has ever wanted to transform it into a law.",
          "Isn't it the credibility that we have built today largely through politics?",
          "Look, we can make progress on immigration, it seems to me that progress has already been made.",
          "The ideological armamentarium of the PD restarts.",
          "But look, if I had presented myself with a structured counter-proposal from the government it would have been said that I didn't want to allow the opposition to do theirs, just as when I proposed to make a comparison with in I was accused of wanting to make the opposition withdraw the proposal.",
          "I mean, internal political issues, no, the fact of privileging one's internal public opinions.",
          "And in fact for ten years now because the tweet that the left is spreading everywhere today from eight years ago we have been saying the same thing that we agree with the jus co.",
          "Who dissolved the coalition at parliamentary level ago?",
          "it is a maneuver resulting from political choices as was right and normal for a political government.",
          "It should have been done months ago, but some members, among the very presentable ones, according to a certain Europeanism, didn't want it because it wasn't convenient for them.",
          "And do you know why friends of the PD, why they don't buy your nonsense anymore?",
          "And if politics wants to deprive us of something, well, it must first demonstrate to us that the benefit will be greater than the sacrifice.",
          "In this year and more in which we have continued to make this proposal to the government, the proposal has never been implemented.",
          "Do you know that there are majority proposals on this matter too?",
          "after that, however, the left tells you that you are authoritarian for whatever it tells you that you are authoritarian.",
          "This is also work that we intend to carry forward, continue to carry forward in the coming weeks because the era in which the State turns the other way in the face of crime and those who do not respect the rules is over.. Public housing buildings should go to those in need, not to the families of criminals.",
          "No government had chosen to address it in a structural way until now.",
          "It's time for citizens to take back their cities.",
          "This is the difference between me and the left.",
          "then a couple of themes from the PD's electoral campaign in the last few hours are worth looking into further.",
          "In France in the last four months they have voted twice once for the presidential elections.",
          "But we didn't do it because it would have been easy, but it wouldn't have been if we were serious about talking about infrastructure.",
          "And that is exactly what our decree provides, the decree that the council of ministers passed.",
          "It is not the first time that the government has dealt with this matter.",
          "And it is also due to this political weakness of the left that we are in the situation we are in, because the left is incapable of reading reality, caught up as it is in its ideological delusions.",
          "In the last twenty years France has had four heads of government which there coincides with the President of the Republic.",
          "For now there is a picket line.",
          "Meanwhile, we vote on one day only, Sunday the 25th of September, from seven in the morning to 11pm you must show up at the polling station with your identity document and electoral card.",
          "We will increase the resources and equipment of the police forces, we will relaunch and strengthen the operation, safe streets, we will increase video surveillance where necessary, we will redevelop the suburbs, especially the most degraded ones, because from the redemption of those areas and the people who live there well-being and safety also pass through and therefore we will encourage the opening of businesses in those areas, especially in the evening hours.",
          "Maybe it was time to create a single party?",
          "Not the name of this party, because in short it's starting to be a bit surreal and ridiculous.",
          "It is therefore necessary, from this point of view, to accompany the current formulation of the law to its expiry according to the principle of legitimate expectations, i.e.",
          "Unless someone believes that the presidency of the republic is, let's say, in competition with the government and therefore we are the institutions were also present to obviously express their condolences.",

          "And above all, let it be known that the only reason why we want to get to the top is that we know that from there we can look further.",
          "So you know that I believe that the theme of our national community and of the League from membership which is what binds us is one of the most important things on which we must leverage to lift this nation.",
          "the right things could have been done instead of doing the easy ones.",
          "We will do it with the aim of uniting this people, of exalting what unites them rather than what divides them.",

          "I want to thank all the citizens who have chosen to place their trust in the centre-right, who have rewarded our good governance, our proposals and our concreteness.",
          "In short, it will be worth thinking about for a moment.",
          "Thank you President, thank you.",
          "Look, I've been considering something more for a few days now, to be honest, and that is to celebrate the next Council of Ministers on the topic of immigration.",
          "A little while ago you gave all the signatures of the soldiers present in this room.",
          "But I can tell you that I am still confident and I can tell you that I am at peace with my conscience because in this year I physically could not have worked more.",
          "Thank you for this friendship that we work to implement.",
          "In moments like these, we are aware of what our armed forces have built in this territory.",

          "Here too we are not sparing ourselves.",
          "It is a victory built with a lot of patience, for which we must also thank the previous government which had instructed it.",

          "Then we will meet President Bonaccini again on Tuesday and also the various territorial economic representatives and we will also try to get them to tell us what the most urgent things are.",
          "In short, it seems to me that it cannot be said that like everyone else I have not done my best to do my job, as is right and normal because my job is to try to solve problems and it is that resignation of plants Tosi opposition asks for the resignation of a different minister every day, so you understand that it is no longer much news.",
          "I say it for you too, for your professionalism",
          "Thank you President, we will continue the conversation Door to Door thanks to you.",
          "We will continue to work.",

          "But what happens today you will remember all your life.",
          "But it also means that we must do this, which we did not have the courage to do enough in the past, that is, work to secure the territory.",

          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "Just what's the difference?",
          "We have always claimed the need for Europe to deal more with the Mediterranean front.",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "And it's not an imposition by the Americans, it's a European choice and it's a wrong choice, because if we are convinced that clearly the destiny of the West as a whole is inextricably linked, well we are equally convinced that not always from one on the other side of the Atlantic the interests are perfectly overlapping.",

          "We want to fight human trafficking, we want to fight illegal entries, we want to fight deaths at sea.",

          "Europe's involvement is fundamental.",
          "If Europe did not lend us a hand in defending the external borders, then in stopping the primary movements.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from Ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "The only way to seriously deal with this matter with humanity is to stop the departures and on this we need a Europe which, in addition to obviously declaring its availability, acts quickly.",
          "And this is the reason why I sent a letter to the European Council and the European Commission today to ask that what we discussed at the last meeting of the European Council be immediately made concrete.",
          "It looks like a Lancia y with the four position indicators lit that was trumpeting and trying to make its way through the intense city traffic.",
          "If you are a cancer patient and want to take a ferry to go for surgery from Sardinia to Rome you cannot get on the ferry and thousands of unvaccinated illegal immigrants disembark.",

          "Look, what I want to do is simply give a signal of attention and respect on an issue that is close to my heart, because unlike those who today propose a minimum wage from the opposition, but when they were in government they did not implement the minimum wage.",
          "Istat says that in June the employment rate reached a new record of sixty-one point five percent, with an increase in employment in the first six months of this year of two hundred and ninety-two thousand people.",
          "There are disagreements on what the tools are to strengthen the purchasing power of families, to strengthen wages.",
          "Amounts too low.",
          "We cut the contribution wedge by four percentage points and this cut adds to what we had already done in the previous budget law.",

          "for those who hire women or young people up to thirty-six years old or recipients of citizenship income.",
          "I believe it is effective to cut taxes on labor, because the reason why wages are inadequate is that taxation is too high for the companies that have to hire them and work to combat discrimination and irregularities.",
          "Well, by reducing the tax wedge, i.e.",
          "Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "But when the king's income actually stopped seven months later we saw that it was much less, about one hundred and twelve thousand.",
          "And I apologize to you for the simple minimum wage measure which, as you know, according to many also according to many trade unions, according to many experts in the sector, in a nation like ours, with very high collective bargaining, risks worsening, paradoxically, the condition more workers than those for whom it could improve it.",
          "Another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "Look, people have very little money.",
          "For this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",
          "For this reason I have chosen to meet the opposition starting from the specific proposal of the minimum wage because the issue of combating poor work interests us, as long as we understand the fact that the subject is an extremely broad subject and that it must be addressed in its entirety complexity.",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "And imagine if he is not sensitive to the issue of increasing wages.",
          "So today and until the end of this year, we have a cut in the contribution wedge of six percentage points for those with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros and even of seven percentage points for the lowest incomes of up to twenty-five thousand euros.",
          "I am thinking of the issue of strengthening the lowest wages, particularly with the cut in the contribution wedge.",
          "I believe that it is much more effective to extend collective bargaining even in sectors where it is not currently foreseen.",
          "Those like us who in just a few months have cut the contribution wedge by up to seven points for the lowest incomes, increasing the net paycheck to workers, have reduced taxes on productivity bonuses, have increased the exemption threshold for Prins benefits, have the season of public sector contract renewals has started, for example with the renewal of the school staff contract.",
          "Increases that can even reach one hundred euros for workers with the lowest incomes.",
          "Now with the reduction of the contribution wedge we are going there on the budget law.",
          "I am thinking of the issue of excise duties and today we are allocating the entire amount of that treasure to the most important cut in labor taxes in recent decades.",
          "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen to seven point four, that is, the lowest level in the last fourteen years and therefore at the end of all the really interesting data is that those who have found a job since the beginning of the year.",
          "I hear people talk about minimum wages and poor work and they don't take into consideration the fact that for ISTAT or Eurostat surveys, poor work means the income you have within the family unit..",
          "Approximately eighty-two percent have a minimum hourly wage higher than the nine euros required by law.",
          "Paradoxically, to look after their interests, the large economic concentrations, which are the only ones that would gain from a generalized reduction in wages, are, let's say, within reach.",
          "The blanket was so short.",
          "That is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",
          "I can announce to you now that the budget law that we will present follows the trend of the previous one, that is, work income, which is what we have already done with all the main provisions of the previous one, starting from the extension of the audience of those who benefited, of the bonus for gas and electricity, up to, let's say, the first signals we have given on productivity bonuses.",
          "And besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "Including legal minimum wage, which has not been approved in the past.",
          "We have cut labor taxes by a further point for an entire year and I tell you more, with the money that was spent in nine months to cut excise duties by the previous government, it would have been possible to have cut labor taxes by approximately seven points, which meant putting up to two hundred euros a month in the pockets of workers with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "In government documents it is written that the reform of the cadastre serves to do what we need Europe is asking and that is to review our taxation by decreasing it on work and compensating the decrease in taxes on work with the revision of cadastral estimates.",
          "In my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, I'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "The Council of the European Union recommends reducing the tax burden on labour, compensating them with a revision of tax breaks and with a reform of cadastral values ​​which are not updated.",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "Because if the legal minimum wage is the solution, why didn't the parties that are now clamoring for it introduce it in the long years in which they were in government?",
          "Okay, so let's forget that cutting the tax wedge, money on families, money on the health fund, anything you can think of couldn't be done.",
          "Because obviously it's the risk that we end up with a minimum wage rule.",
          "According to the principle of those who hire more, pay less taxes, this is an objective that we want to achieve during the legislature.",
          "I apologize for the addition of the protections guaranteed to workers, but a substitute parameter, a single parameter, and in our system a parameter of this type would risk, paradoxically, creating worse conditions for many workers than those they have today and paradoxically doing them a favor to large economic concentrations in which it is appropriate to review workers' rights downwards.",
          "From the beginning it is the reason why in this, in these less than a year, we have concentrated the few resources we had at our disposal on cutting the contribution wedge, that is, putting more money in people's paychecks.",
          "How much does it cost?",
          "Really who concentrated on increasing wages?",
          "Now, in my opinion, let's say he will question me on the hypothesis that the legal minimum wage could become not a substitute parameter and let's say a parameter.",
          "your first.",
          "And already in the first months of the legislature, despite the inevitably limited resources we have available, we have given signals in this sense, interventions to protect the purchasing power of families and workers, the renewal of the two-point cut percentages of the tax and contribution wedge which it is worth remembering the previous government had foreseen until the end of last year and the addition of a further point of the contribution cut for the lowest incomes.",
          "We not only confirm the two percent cut for incomes up to thirty-five thousand euros entirely on the worker's side which was already foreseen and which we have extended.",
          "It is a contract that normally has a decent salary because there are minimums for sickness, holidays, thirteenth salary, severance pay.",
          "I agree with the cut, but in my opinion the priorities now were different.",
          "But then why didn't we accept the opposition's proposal on the legal minimum wage as it was presented?",
          "Six points for incomes up to thirty-five thousand euros, seven points for incomes up to twenty-five thousand euros means increases in the paycheck that can reach one hundred euros.",

          "Nobody says that we in Ukraine brought electric generators because there are people who risk dying of cold, there are people who don't have electricity, children, families, normal people, attacked with missiles that bomb strategic infrastructures to subvert the population with the cold, with hunger, with the darkness.",
          "Shall we censor Dostoievski to bash Putin?",
          "the other one.",
          "The very bad Eastern countries, first of all Poland and Hungary, threatened, insulted for years by the European Commission, by the left, by the mainstream media.",
          "nations represented in the G twenty collectively represent two-thirds of the world's population, seventy-five percent of trade, eighty percent of the world's gross domestic product.",
          "Giorgia Meloni defined Putin as the emblem of the defense of Europe and Christian values.",
          "But look, I expect that, the legitimate aspirations of individual nations do not come at the expense of others and that therefore a balance can be found.",
          "I am convinced that our allies will also be aware of the fact that the weight that we all carry on our shoulders is so serious that we cannot waste energy on selfish attitudes of any kind..",
          "How much filling is it?",
          "Look, I thank you for this question because you see, for days I have been reading a curious reconstruction according to which it is written in my book that Putin is a bulwark of the defense of Christian values.",
          "No, Putin defends European values ​​and Christian identity.",
          "Or should it rather be the expected opposite, that is, a figure, for example, like Dostoievski is exactly the cultural antidote against every form of autocracy, including the Putinian one if desired.",
          "PS says my colleague Quartapelle in these delusional statements that we will be part of a right-wing international supported financially by Russia.",
          "And what will your government's strategy be at that point?",
          "Director, we do not spend money to buy weapons that we send to the Ukrainians.",
          "You are four kilometers away.",
          "And one fact that is emerging with the war in Ukraine is the bleak reality of left-wing leadership in the West.",
          "And look, I say it with respect, I say it with respect for the category of waiters, but I have seen many more waiters among certain young journalists than among the entire Ukrainian people, which one?",
          "How you do it?",
          "Pro-Putin?",
          "Also in your book you wrote that Russia is part of our system of European values.",
          "If there were an index of names it would be discovered that the word Putin is never mentioned.",
          "I understand all the difficulties and doubts of the citizens, but I also think that it should be clear that it is an illusion to think that if we did not support the Ukrainians we would have peace, we would not have peace we would have an invasion and that invasion would bring war closer at our home.",
          "But this does not prevent me from considering Russia as, let's say, a nation that we say on the level of the cultural system of values ​​is, is, is, is part of the European system.",
          "It must do so in peace with neighboring nations and the European states that border the great Russian bear must be able to look to the future with serenity.",

          "That is, you have to know when you go to get petrol, whether where you are getting petrol compared to what the average does, let's say for all the others, is convenient for you or not, because this automatically helps us to fight some of those who may be the not many.",
          "And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.",

          "There are many more who have lost their citizenship income.",
          "But I want to be clear: the government does not intend to go back on its steps on the subject of citizenship income, because our great objective remains to move from citizenship income to employment income, that is, the income obtained thanks to work.. And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view.",
          "And then it was said that people who lose their income because they are able to work are left alone.",

          "Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.",
          "And if instead in those three years he had had the opportunity to work and improve himself, he would have been richer and poorer..",
          "Now this is a topic on which I have read and heard a lot of controversy and many falsehoods and I think it is useful to clarify things a little.. First, they do not lose their citizenship income.",
          "According to data from the scientific evaluation committee of the P n R R of the Ministry of Labour, there are approximately fifty percent of the recipients of citizenship income and practically none of these people have found a job thanks to those mythological Navigators which are another brilliant idea of ​​the Five Star Movement.",
