          "There are ways to finance these interventions: the extra revenue can be used, i.e.",
          "Part of these resources are recovered from a redefinition of the rule on extra profits which should overcome, let's say, some of the elements that were at the basis of the disputes that were raised and allow us to recover around two and a half billion.",

          "On the one hand we certainly have an enormous need to defend the competitiveness of our system, but not because the United States has angered the Infn Reduction Act, but because it is a moment in which we must question the choices that they have, for example in terms of supply chains, returned to controlling their own fundamental supply chains.",

          "Unfortunately, the provision, due to a rule that was objectively poorly written, gave rise to various frauds and led to an unjustified increase in the price of building materials.. To try to correct the initial errors, the government changed the rules for accessing and operating the fund several times during the course.",
          "This has led to a situation in which prices increase, the cost of money increases and therefore also the cost of variable rate mortgages of new mortgages of existing loans and also leads to a contraction of the economy.",

          "What was the cash ceiling in 2010?",

          "So the biggest increase in relation to let's say inflation will be the lowest pensions, all pensions up to two thousand euros and above are revalued by one hundred percent.",
          "But it is obvious that a new credit, given that the superbonus measure continues to generate around three billion euros of credits per month.",
          "The first is that we do not allow the purchase of those credits by the Public Administration, therefore regions and municipalities, because some were gearing up, obviously in an attempt to find a solution to do so, but there is a problem that these credits have practically generated a sort of parallel currency and that parallel currency risks impacting public budgets in a devastating way.",
          "The state reimburses anyway and this obviously produced a series of results, including that the costs of materials have risen exorbitantly and that the bubble has slowly inflated.",

          "the situation is very complex and there are various different emergencies.",
          "Are we defending something else?",

          "I apologize for the addition of the protections guaranteed to workers, but a substitute parameter, a single parameter, and in our system a parameter of this type would risk, paradoxically, creating worse conditions for many workers than those they have today and paradoxically doing them a favor to large economic concentrations in which it is appropriate to review workers' rights downwards.",
          "We choose to do it before it becomes an emergency.",
          "We want to defend people who keep our beaches clean, those who risk their lives to save swimmers, those who have invested and got into debt to make their company which they had created on state property even more beautiful, trusting the state, respecting the rules of State.",
          "We defend those who get up at five in the morning praying on a beautiful sunny day.",

          "Paradoxically, to look after their interests, the large economic concentrations, which are the only ones that would gain from a generalized reduction in wages, are, let's say, within reach.",
          "Because obviously it's the risk that we end up with a minimum wage rule.",
          "For this reason I have chosen to meet the opposition starting from the specific proposal of the minimum wage because the issue of combating poor work interests us, as long as we understand the fact that the subject is an extremely broad subject and that it must be addressed in its entirety complexity.",
          "Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "Approximately eighty-two percent have a minimum hourly wage higher than the nine euros required by law.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "Fair work, paid adequately as this government has particularly demonstrated, putting most of its resources on cutting the contribution wedge, guaranteeing adequate wages and defending the purchasing power of families is one of our absolute priorities.",
          "Now, in my opinion, let's say he will question me on the hypothesis that the legal minimum wage could become not a substitute parameter and let's say a parameter.",
          "And besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",

          "In my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, I'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "And I apologize to you for the simple minimum wage measure which, as you know, according to many also according to many trade unions, according to many experts in the sector, in a nation like ours, with very high collective bargaining, risks worsening, paradoxically, the condition more workers than those for whom it could improve it.",
          "Really who concentrated on increasing wages?",
          "But we are obviously open to discussion on the subject, which is much broader than poor work and adequate wages.",
          "The bulk of his measures are those who defend poor work as I hear some political exponents say and who instead has led to the inadequate wages we have today are friends of the workers because now that he is in opposition he is proposing the minimum wage?",
          "And if instead in those three years he had had the opportunity to work and improve himself, he would have been richer and poorer..",
          "There is a start of what we have defined as the more you hire, the less you pay, i.e.",
          "I believe that it is much more effective to extend collective bargaining even in sectors where it is not currently foreseen.",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "Another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "Look, what I want to do is simply give a signal of attention and respect on an issue that is close to my heart, because unlike those who today propose a minimum wage from the opposition, but when they were in government they did not implement the minimum wage.",
          "That is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",
          "Because if the legal minimum wage is the solution, why didn't the parties that are now clamoring for it introduce it in the long years in which they were in government?",
          "Including legal minimum wage, which has not been approved in the past.",
          "For this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",

          "something new has been added in recent weeks, namely that this government has started its own.",
          "It is not the first time that the government has dealt with this matter.",
          "The government is there, well, it's one of those situations in which all institutional levels need to work to the maximum of their possibilities and in short, I hope it can be seen that we are there",
          "So this is a government that on the international level, on the national level, on the economic level, on the level, cannot decide anything.",
          "The right state must help you find a job because work produces a possibility of improving your condition, whereas if I always keep you in the same condition.",

          "This is not the case because it is not the State that generates work.",
          "But for the State to be able to take care of those in need because they have no alternatives, people need to work if instead we all think we can stay there with the State that will give us a solution.",
          "We have always maintained that a just state should not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level of assistance, that the two things are very different and that a just state should ensure security in terms of assistance for those who are not able to work?",
          "So what do the right states do?",
          "a just state does not put those who can work and those who cannot on the same level of welfare because if it does so with limited resources it ends up hitting the weakest.",
          "I don't want to leave his behind, but for the State not to leave anyone behind, it must be fair, a fair State does not put those who can work and those who cannot do so on the same level as welfare because it ends up discriminating against the weakest.",
          "Because a state that tells you to stay at home, I don't need you, is not a state that is educating you.",
          "the State does not create wealth and jobs, it is businesses and workers who do it.",
          "What does a just state do, a just state provides decent assistance for those who are not able to work and takes care of those who are not able to work, but for those who can work.",
          "This makes a just state.",
          "The State can create the conditions to favor those who generate work, because companies create work, with their capacity.",
          "Because one thing is that you clearly have no alternatives and therefore the State must take care of you.",
          "Apart from the fact that I don't agree, I agree with a state that tells these kids to stay at home deserted, I need you.",
          "What the State can do, however, is establish rules that favor those who create that wealth and those jobs.",
          "On the other hand we said that in the future it will no longer be possible to exceed those credits.",
          "For this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",
          "To dispose of these credits.",
          "We must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "And obviously it also happened that the bubble inflated so much that at a certain point those who had these credits, mainly companies, could no longer compensate them because they had exhausted, let's say, their possibility of compensating that credit with taxes and could no longer not even to sell them, because even the fiscal drawers of the banks of the other actors who could buy those credits have closed and there are perfectly honest people who have done some work, who have trusted the State, who have done what the State said which found itself in the hands of some work done and money that it cannot take because this has produced this very interesting free measure that today we have thousands of companies that risk collapse and therefore since we inherited it, we now have to look for a solution to prevent thousands of companies from risking collapse because someone could say during the election campaign that they renovated houses for free and that's exactly what we tried to do.",
          "Instead we want to push as much as possible banks, companies and all the actors involved to allow the acquisition of credits that are already at a standstill, those so-called stranded credits, i.e.",
          "Which means that if we left the transferability of those credits throughout this year, at the end of this year we would have at least another forty million euros.",
          "Families and entrepreneurs are increasingly resorting to usurious credit, because the banks, immobilized by regulations that are too stringent, are actually unable to respond to the current demand for credit.",
          "But above all because obviously those who have to take out a loan prefer to do so on a new loan rather than an old one.",
          "Even at the beginning it was not possible on credits that had been sold even ten times.",
          "But it's obvious that for goodness' sake, if you take someone's credit and you haven't even gone to check whether not only the work has been done, but whether the property exists as happened, you are co-responsible because in short, a minimum of control should done, but if you couldn't have known some things.",
          "We have made a rule that allows us to say Don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
          "In our opinion, in this difficult situation it is essential for the banking system to behave, so to speak, in the most correct manner possible.",
          "This change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "Because in all of this, since there have been many scams in this matter, obviously those who have to acquire the credit are afraid of being co-responsible for anyone who may have generated a scam.",
          "Above all because in our opinion this is one of the most effective ways to help the so-called exoduses of the one hundred and ten, that is, those companies that have remained in the hands of those people who have been left in the hands of credits and money for work done that they risk not seeing and therefore we must facilitate the purchase of those credits.",
          "You cannot assign the credit you have generated to another actor.",
          "In reality we don't want to abolish it.",
          "We are the autonomous, free right, capable of building its own proposal that is different from that of everyone else, but which everyone else will have to deal with.",
          "No government had chosen to address it in a structural way until now.",
          "We don't intend to do that.",
          "Excuse me, do you want to change the one hundred and ninety-four or not?",
          "When I think something I say it, if I had wanted to abolish or modify law one hundred and ninety-four I would have declared it because I am different from many other politicians I have seen.",
          "In short, at the time of conversion, if anyone thinks that the law could be done better, we are available to listen, as long as we say the criticisms are not specious because in recent days I have objectively heard everything.",
          "no regulatory changes for those who had already started the works which fell within.",
          "We do not intend to abolish Law One Hundred and Ninety-Four.",
          "But this doesn't mean that others have to give up their proposals or that I have to come and say This is my proposal and it doesn't have to be yours.",
          "we do not intend to modify law one hundred and ninety-four.",
          "It's a debate that I really like, it makes me smile a lot, it's the same thing I've been saying since the beginning of my life and the fact that people continue to unexpectedly say that I want to abolish the one hundred and ninety-four is not understood based on what you know why it bothers me ?",
          "One hundred and ten for the future.",
          "In this year and more in which we have continued to make this proposal to the government, the proposal has never been implemented.",
          "This is the reason why we did not vote for the opposition proposal.",
          "Is there no structured counter-proposal from the government or not?",
          "Giorgia Meloni defined Putin as the emblem of the defense of Europe and Christian values.",
          "But this does not prevent me from considering Russia as, let's say, a nation that we say on the level of the cultural system of values ​​is, is, is, is part of the European system.",
          "Three seconds, Russia is part of our system of European values, it defends Christian identity and fights Islamic fundamentalism.",
          "Or should it rather be the expected opposite, that is, a figure, for example, like Dostoievski is exactly the cultural antidote against every form of autocracy, including the Putinian one if desired.",
          "But frankly, all the possible evil is attributed to the tones, the contents, the contrasts which seem to me to follow in tone the deadly anger of the other side, that is, Putin Kiril.",
          "Look, I thank you for this question because you see, for days I have been reading a curious reconstruction according to which it is written in my book that Putin is a bulwark of the defense of Christian values.",
          "But I believe that anyone with banal hints of history, literature, culture cannot deny that Russia is part, let's say, of the European value system, regardless of what its political destiny has been.. Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.",
          "Pro-Putin?",
          "Yes, yes, because also from the world l G B T. Yes, we must also dispel this prejudice that one must necessarily be a communist.",
          "No, Putin defends European values ​​and Christian identity.",
          "I don't consider Russia Putin, let's say I have no closeness to the figure of Putin.",
          "Also in your book you wrote that Russia is part of our system of European values.",
          "It must do so in peace with neighboring nations and the European states that border the great Russian bear must be able to look to the future with serenity.",
          "And today they also claim the values ​​of God, homeland and family, but they see them as characteristic of Russia and as a nose in complete decadence in the West.",

          "Well, I think it's important.",

          "And I think it is a job on which everyone must involve.",

          "We have decided what our priorities were.",
          "We have demonstrated with facts that we care about this issue because everything we have done, the bulk of what we have done has been dedicated to this matter.",

          "And we are very clear about what the next step should be.",

          "And Merry Christmas everyone!",
          "Not only because there were gifts, but because of the meaning that those gifts have that I carry with me And in short, that's it.",
          "Don't make this symbolic gesture of being here to say thank you, to say that even though you are four thousand kilometers away from home, you are not far from home.",
          "Merry Christmas to you, to your distant families.",
          "I decided to make a nativity scene when no one does it anymore.",
          "So obviously thanks to everyone and merry Christmas to you and your families, who are unfortunately far away.",
          "I decided to make a nativity scene when in schools they say it can't be done because otherwise it offends those who believe in another culture and I just can't get over it.",

          "Homework is good measures, they are useful measures.",
          "What are the measures?",
          "Frankly, among other things, it wouldn't make sense on such an important measure.",
          "Still on the subject of the single allowance, another measure that may seem obvious, but is not.",
          "Eh, there are the measures.",
          "So in the meantime, obviously the measure was not free at all.",
          "But what priorities did you set with the first measures?",
          "It will probably be easier than what happens in Campania, where a quarter of those excluded from the measure live.",
          "In truth, these are measures that already exist on paper, but which need to be enormously strengthened.",
          "And I also believe that we need to work a little on scams, because we have also seen several scams on this measure.",
          "These are measures that favor work.",
          "So let's say about what has been done the most with a maximum threshold of forty thousand euros, which means that the measure is a measure aimed at the middle class.",
          "And this is interesting because I remember when someone who invented this measure went around during the election campaign saying that thanks to him you were able to renovate your house for free.",
          "That is, you have to know when you go to get petrol, whether where you are getting petrol compared to what the average does, let's say for all the others, is convenient for you or not, because this automatically helps us to fight some of those who may be the not many.",
          "Now since I am a serious person and obviously I monitor the results of what I produce, I am monitoring the price of petrol.",
          "Because they are so strong with the weak and weak, with the strong ceiling on gas in Europe immediately.",
          "Obviously the international question, the crisis in Ukraine, the eh, the domino, so to speak, of consequences, which therefore obviously produces the issue of the need to give concreteness to a European solution on the issue of rising costs as soon as possible of energy on the topic of a note on a cap on the price of gas that was discussed.",
          "The European Union suddenly found itself hostage to Russian blackmail on gas and harnessed to an energy pricing mechanism that actually encourages speculation.",
          "Now here is something that needs to be explained everyone all the petrol stations in Italy are required to communicate to the institutions if they make price changes some do not make these communications.",
          "And beyond this, the price of energy must be immediately disconnected from the price of gas.",
          "Basic hygiene, petrol has reached two and twenty euros.",
          "Because first of all I hear about petrol costing two and a half euros and petrol is at an average of one euro point eight point second in the Brothers of Italy program it doesn't say that we would cut excise duties and I never talked about cutting excise duties as a priority in this election campaign.",
          "After that, there is certainly an intervention that needs to be done with regards to the motorway network, where sometimes the price is um, can be significantly higher by virtue of the concessions, because sometimes in service stations the motorway manager gives a sub concession and in this passage sometimes some rules are skipped and therefore I think that on this too we need to make the concessionaires responsible for future concessions to monitor what happens.",
          "The decrease in the cost of energy is favoring production, encouraging companies to start hiring again and it was therefore certainly the right choice to continue the battle for the introduction of a European ceiling on the price of gas",
          "what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes.",
          "And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.",

          "We want to fight to stop the illegal trafficking of approximately three hundred thousand puppies that arrive from Eastern Europe and are sold in Italy every year for thousands of euros as purebred dogs, after having undergone endless days of travel in pitiful conditions.. And then we want to expand pet therapy activities and where possible we will let our animal friends enter nursing homes and hospitals, because even the company of those who love us is therapy.",
          "The decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",

          "I mean, there are several companies that ask the government within the flow decree on immigration to let in some immigrants who they need to do jobs.",
          "But to carry out this commitment it is necessary to know data and numbers, to understand in depth the scenario in which to move, to have in our eyes and hearts the stories of those who suffer abuse, persecution, violence.",

          "Then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the Mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from Ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "We were not warned that this vessel was in danger of sinking.",
          "you know that there are almost twenty million dogs and cats that live in our homes as four-legged family members.",
          "Around twenty-five thousand people, but also in Campania around one hundred and eight thousand new hires are expected and therefore there seems to be some possibility of finding employment.",
          "those which are no longer compensable and which no one wants to take and which therefore they are currently not transferable.",
          "There are many more who have lost their citizenship income.",
          "Preventing people from having fun as I have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",
          "I therefore confirm that we intend to modify this rule without taking these resources away from their original destination, which is young people and culture.",
          "I was also moved.",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "I heard that we want to ban demonstrations.",
          "For them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",
          "Well, starting next week we are working on new rules to stop trafficking, because we don't intend to give up on this issue.",
          "also on the topic of citizenship income I want to try to be clear because I know that this is a city in which no, there are many recipients of citizenship income and I want to say to these people don't be afraid because I don't want to leave anyone behind.",
          "Now this is a topic on which I have read and heard a lot of controversy and many falsehoods and I think it is useful to clarify things a little.. First, they do not lose their citizenship income.",
          "businesses and citizens left respectively with tax credits and blocked jobs who are prisoners of the frequent regulatory changes.",
          "Furthermore, three private homes plus one belonging to the INPS were evicted.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "For them there are only those who would like to work and those who would like to work should be beaten, but who instead commits crimes?",
          "We do this to comply with international law.",
          "We are used to an Italy that is mainly concerned with going in search of migrants throughout the Mediterranean.",
          "This means firmly combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, it means protecting those who have the right to international protection and managing legal immigration in an orderly manner through flow decrees.. All within a framework of responsibility that must also involve the other European states.",
          "Mass immigration is a phenomenon of very wide scope, which obviously concerns the lives of migrants, which concerns the protection of the most vulnerable, but which also concerns the safety of citizens and the social protection of our societies.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "But refugees are not about welcoming a community, giving hospitality to a community that in Italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules.",
          "If you are a cancer patient and want to take a ferry to go for surgery from Sardinia to Rome you cannot get on the ferry and thousands of unvaccinated illegal immigrants disembark.",
          "This is what we called the Mattei plan, that is, a cooperation strategy that is centered on an equal relationship, a relationship of mutual growth and interest to guarantee African populations the fundamental right not to be forced to migrate in search of a better life.",
          "What happens if these rules are not respected is that there is no authorization to enter international waters and if that authorization is violated the vessel is administratively detained the first time for two months, the second time with seizure for the purposes of confiscation.",
          "We need rules to prevent that um, in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",
          "It means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "If you don't have the green pass, then we had a virus that came from China, but we don't want to import the Chinese model.",
          "This, from my point of view, changes many things in the European approach to the migration issue.",
          "What this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",
          "I think of the fact that we have had concrete references, for example to migration issues, in line with what is the Rome process, our conference on development and migration with India, the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Arabia Saudi, United Emirates.",
          "The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",
          "That is, very few people have been relocated in recent months, so it's a bit like, let's say, a Linus blanket.",
          "But I also want to tell you that the issue of so-called relocations is secondary in the very complex situation we are facing.",
          "The government does not intend to change its position on the issue of immigration.",
          "We do not want in any way to continue to favor human traffickers.",
          "Also, sorry, but how is this defense of illegal raves compatible in your opinion?",
          "The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.",
          "Why the drafts The draft conclusions If we look at the past on the topic of the external dimension, on the topic of the fact that the migration issue is a European issue on the topic of the specificity of the maritime border, which obviously needs different responses, it is a huge step ahead of the past.",
          "That is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",
          "risk that at a certain point someone decides to free the world from this very dangerous person, because maybe there are some wheels out of place and he doesn't understand the game there is.",
          "But this was certainly the case with regards to the migration dossier.",
          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "Well, I am moved, I am often moved, but I found many people moved, clearly moved by the tragedy they were experiencing, but also moved by Speranza No and I was saying for us it is important to give immediate answers.",
          "Yet it is estimated that every year around eighty thousand cats and fifty thousand dogs are abandoned, more than eighty percent of which risk dying from accidents or starvation.. Pets are part of the family in every respect and Brothers of Italy intends to fight to guarantee them a dignified and loving life among our initiatives already launched in this legislature.",
          "as far as the rule on raves is concerned, look, I agree with what I heard the plant minister Tosi say if I'm not mistaken today in an interview if anyone has ideas to improve the rule and Parliament exists for this,",
          "International law provides something very clear: you are obliged to save someone if you accidentally meet them and if someone is at risk.",
          "the immigration issue.",
