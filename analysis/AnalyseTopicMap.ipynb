Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]  \n",

       "25  [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.]  \n",

And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., And a little, perhaps also because these people knew that at a certain point they would no longer be able to count on the income and so perhaps they rolled up their sleeves and started looking for a job which they found fourth, but it was said that if the income ends in August and the support tool starts in September for a month, these people are left with nothing., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]  \n",

       "25  [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.]  \n",

And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., And a little, perhaps also because these people knew that at a certain point they would no longer be able to count on the income and so perhaps they rolled up their sleeves and started looking for a job which they found fourth, but it was said that if the income ends in August and the support tool starts in September for a month, these people are left with nothing., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]  \n",

          "As you know, I wanted to organize the first institutional visit of the Italian government outside its national borders here in Brussels.",
          "Like it or not, this is sacred.",
          "we also have the dispute.",
          "But anyone arriving from outside the European Union before opening the shutter will have to present a surety to guarantee the payment of taxes, so that everyone can compete on equal terms.. We will restore dignity and freedom to the honest people who create work and wealth in Italy.",
          "Because we are in a European market.",
          "We want to defend those who arrive at the end of the season with calluses on their hands.",
          "Our close collaboration with Italy that I am now can't wait to begin our responses.",
          "Because Salvini says we are here, we are here as a coalition as loose as snow in the sun.",

          "Doing it with sincerity, with dedication, even with a willingness to sacrifice, led me to be the first female Prime Minister in Italy.. Maybe I could get somewhere else.",
          "And yes, we think that the nine billion euros of public resources that have been allocated to citizens' income every year in recent years can be spent.",
          "And so we must give the session a round of applause.",
          "The reason why you will not govern with Italian brothers is that we are the ones who don't want it.",
          "Because the scenes of degradation, abandonment, confusion that we sometimes see in a difficult moment in our lives, that is, when we need emergency healthcare, are not tolerable.",
          "Mrs. Boldrini, however, gives us something even more fantastic.",
          "I consider it a courageous maneuver.",
          "And that is exactly what our decree provides, the decree that the council of ministers passed.",

          "I am satisfied, I am satisfied with the bilateral meetings.",
          "Obviously intervening to tackle the phenomenon of poor labor is inevitably one of the priorities on which this government works, because, as the questioners the Honorable, Schlein and others point out, Italy is the only OECD country in which from ninety to two thousand and twenty the average annual salary has decreased, while in the rest of the West it was growing.",
          "There are ways to finance these interventions: the extra revenue can be used, i.e.",
          "Less difficult.",
          "But even more important will be the information and training campaigns on respect for animals which must be carried out starting from schools.",

          "Also for this reason, from 2000 to 2019, Italy grew less than anyone else in Europe, only four percent, in the same period in which France and Germany grew by more than twenty percent..",
          "So on the one hand, in my opinion, we need to continue working to encourage growth.",
          "In recent years many people have been overwhelmed by economic difficulties and a perverse system, instead of helping them, has ended up taking away their homes too.",
          "among Mr. Pino also someone from the community, the G B T. Do you have sympathy for Giorgia Meloni?",
          "It is not fair that families and businesses always pay the price for the mistakes made in Europe and made over the years by governments.",
          "and even more I think we must be satisfied with the result regarding the issue of immigration on the immigration issue.",
          "That is, it means that families spent more to buy less.",
          "A result that encourages us to move forward and do even better.",
          "Because we want to break this track",
          "And one fact that is emerging with the war in Ukraine is the bleak reality of left-wing leadership in the West.",
          "Then from these first meetings a series of obviously very concrete dossiers will arise on the various subjects.",
          "Meanwhile, the famous democratic party says on television that if the brothers of Italy democratically won the elections they could govern it.",
          "This is perhaps now one of the most strategic things to do to understand where responsibility should lie, to understand how we can concentrate all the resources we have at what are now many institutional levels and try to concentrate them to immediately spend what we can spend.",
          "A great Italian liberal philosopher, Benedetto Croce, who in a few days will mark the seventieth anniversary of his death and who dedicated his life to the love and study of freedom, said there are those who question the future of the ideal of freedom?",
          "Overcoming the demographic winter, Pope Francis told us, means fighting something that goes against our families, against our homeland, against our future.",
          "I want to thank the Minister of Food Sovereignty, Francesco Lollobrigida, because the Ministry of Food Sovereignty has activated a further initiative.",
          "Let's try to think together.",
          "But obviously this doesn't mean that the topic isn't close to our hearts.",
          "On this we have proposed a work to be done together, to be completed in the next sixty days, on which I already have the availability of the CNEL and its president to understand if there is a margin for sharing solutions between the political forces and with the social partners that can be effective in promoting work.",
          "But clearly anything that wants to be remotely serious has to have a cover.",
          "Political instability is a major factor in our economic decline.",
          "I agree with the cut, but in my opinion the priorities now were different.",
          "Good morning.",
          "If in your opinion Giorgia Meloni and her brothers from Italy could, if they won the elections, govern and while it's funny, why do you think they would govern well or badly in something you say?",
          "And what we intend to do and what we are starting to do in part because in the financial package there is, for example, a total exemption from contributions for those who employ certain categories of people, including those receiving citizen's income.",
          "You are great ambassadors of Italian culture, but above all for what you do for your nation.",
          "In the meantime, what has the government done?",
          "He has this attitude, it's all up to me.",
          "Have your beautiful party with the people who can contain the area according to the regulations.",
          "I think that should be used too.",
          "Still on the subject of the single allowance, another measure that may seem obvious, but is not.",
          "Legislative objective.",
          "So accompany us okay, the important thing is that you continue not to let the message be mediated.",
          "We want to fight human trafficking, we want to fight illegal entries, we want to fight deaths at sea.",
          "That is, either here we understand that we need to get the economy moving again and that getting the economy moving again is the only way to guarantee wages and incomes.",
          "And so we are not Martians, we are real people who explain their positions.",
          "Those who want to be proud of their nation, their people, their flag again.",
          "I think it would be madness and that the authority of Mario Draghi would require us to go to Europe and say Gentlemen, you will not carry out social butchery on the ge- on my people you cannot do this job given that, moreover, you are giving us the money for Most of the time, it's not like you're giving them to us as a gift.",
          "Today, as you know, I met the President of the European Parliament Roberta Mazzola, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the President of the European Council Charles Michel and I also met Commissioner Gentiloni for lunch.",
          "In the meantime, we want to continue to protect the most vulnerable.",
          "Wouldn't it have been difficult to verify when that program was referring to which are clearly totally decontextualized today?",
          "And I obviously spoke with President Bonaccini, with the mayors and obviously with the civil protection to understand what the priority things should be.",
          "Come on.",
          "whatever I have done in my life, most have bet on my failure, it has something to do with the fact that I was a woman, probably yes, and it is something that I realized very late in my existence.",
          "It was not necessary to deprive our children, the young people of their sociality, of the education of their normality.",
          "In celebrating it, the law condemns not only the regimes of the past, but also the risk of the emergence of new forms of repression of freedom.",
          "The point is that the measure was written so badly and made so badly that it generated an enormous series of problems that we today have inherited and are required to try to resolve because the super bonus essentially had two big errors.",
          "Minister Uccella is the one who struck me so much to talk about authoritarian drift.",
          "If we have brothers from Italy as a driving force, we have the certainty that the government with the Democratic Party does not exist because I do not have a government with the left five-star Democratic Party, Renzi and company..",
          "Ambassador, this is for you, it is the coat of arms of Palazzo Chigi where I am, in short, in a more welcoming house than yours.",
          "It is thanks to the example of young people like Jan Palach who gave their lives for the freedom of their people, that today Europe no longer lives under the game of dictatorship.",
          "This is one of our many missions.",
          "Because today we also live this absurdity.",
          "Thanks to you.",
          "They say it to me, to us, to the brothers of Italy, that we learned something about poverty, about the suburbs, about the harshness of life, on our own skin, not in the dissertations of the living rooms or by watching some documentary like this is how the poor.",
          "I was hoping it would go well.",
          "That is, we come from legislatures in which we were essentially told that work could be created by decree, that poverty could be eliminated by decree.",
          "In recent months the government has already increased hiring among those called to help.",
          "Clearly I aim to arrive at a proposal in time for the budget law, but I wouldn't want it to be simply a proposal from the majority as opposed to that of the opposition.",
          "so we spent three days talking about this stuff here and many other things I could say, but I promised I wouldn't bore you too much on this matter.",
          "Go ahead if you are capable and of people who perhaps weren't capable and who got to where they got to because they were left-wing.",
          "And I say this with pride, also thinking of the many who instrumentally predict that they were betting on a centre-right-led Italy that would be isolated on an international level.",
          "Kind of like all us idiots do.",
          "They tell you that you are authoritarian, if you even complain because there are people who prevent a minister of the Republic from presenting the book on the history of his family in a book fair.",
          "must end.",
          "No, someone owes me this because those who paradoxically support this thesis are the ones who were in government.",
          "So let's start from this assumption in the Italian legal system there have always been measures that allowed renovation and energy efficiency works to be deducted from taxes.",
          "I am sincerely close to the pain of those who have lost loved ones and to the communities that have been most affected.",
          "So Italy must say thank you.",
          "I apologize for the emotion of approaching that table together with the medical team, seeing that that child was defenseless, unable to do anything, it was truly a suspenseful thing, without even knowing what was happening..",
          "But above all because, paradoxically, the lower the cash limit, the greater the risk of evasion.",
          "and secondly, however, I wanted to take a quick assessment of this day before the last appointment which is dinner, dinner with the the working dinner, obviously with President Michel.",
          "And what if we don't have to do a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth dose?",
          "But we must not and cannot limit ourselves to these emergency interventions because using all available means does not mean, I say clearly, that today we have all the necessary means.",
          "To be a good magistrate, you don't necessarily have to be a member of a democratic judiciary.",
          "Then on the topic of tax evasion I also want to say something because I have heard many things about the fact that this maneuver favors tax evaders.",
          "first I see great enthusiasm.",
          "no, sorry, but he's schizophrenic.",
          "We desperately need the youth of this nation desperately to believe in them and for them to believe in themselves.",
          "If Von Der Line asked Draghi for a study on Europe's competitiveness and this was seen as an anti-Italian government initiative But why not?",
          "But precisely because I don't want to leave anyone behind, I don't like a policy that keeps you a slave to having to vote for it in order to get something in return.",
          "The agreement reached in Europe on the gas price cap is a great Italian victory.",
          "we believe that it is very important to bring young people closer to culture, so much so that in parallel to what Minister San Giuliano already has, the Minister of Culture is working on a culture charter by doing, let's say, a job with all the operators of the sector to promote cultural content, for young people, to give them further opportunities.",
          "Are we also talking about a change of direction by the government here?",
          "this is written in Giorgio Meloni's book for those who don't want to do propaganda and for those who are interested, let's say, in talking about serious topics without having to hit someone just because they dislike them.",
          "And we do this by networking, in a control room, all the various institutional levels that deal with this matter and simplifying the procedures for some works that are important.",
          "Even at the beginning it was not possible on credits that had been sold even ten times.",
          "Then even funnier than this is the reason why brothers of Italy could not govern even if the citizens, a sovereign people, voted for it because it is an illiberal party, which is an illiberal party because it is against the reform of the land registry, is an illiberal party, because it is opposed to the expropriation of beach businesses by the government to auction off the establishments and give them to foreign multinationals.",
          "We go around leaving a piece of Italy and this is the reason why we have, I mean, this ability to build solid relationships from those relationships.",
          "Did you succeed?",
          "I think swabs continue to be useful.",
          "And I asked what the contracts were with which these irregular immigrants that we want to bring into Italy would work and I was told national collective contract.",
          "Well, I think it's important.",
          "On an economic level we must remember that the wine sector in Italy is worth over thirty billion euros, which employs over eight hundred and seventy thousand workers, first in the trade balance of our, of our made in And therefore obviously it is in our interest our duty, to support this world, also supporting it with generational change.",
          "We not only confirm the two percent cut for incomes up to thirty-five thousand euros entirely on the worker's side which was already foreseen and which we have extended.",
          "Look, democracy has never been a problem for us.",
          "There is a right that is reliable, credible, capable of governing, perfectly presentable and which achieves results that others have not achieved.",
          "Let's say we weren't lucky.",
          "Now we all begin to assume our responsibilities.",
          "Well, in the meantime he was saying it doesn't seem like he's not saying that the Nazis are coming, but the Nazis shouldn't be coming.",
          "But obviously Italy continues to be fully committed to our contribution, the all-round contribution because we are aware of how we have said it several times?",
          "Today there is one that particularly concerns those one million three hundred thousand families who have greater difficulty in purchasing basic necessities, the famous Dear Cart.",
          "But above all I must thank the volunteers, the firefighters, the members of the armed forces and the police forces.",
          "I mean, leaving aside the scandals, the scams, the missed checks that have filled the news every day related to the topic of citizen's income in these years in which this measure has been in place, what do we want to do?",
          "Nowadays everyone says it.",
          "Or will we continue to imagine solutions which unfortunately will not solve the bulk of the problem, which is the reason why we have started working mainly on growth.",
          "I ask Giuseppe to the President.",
          "I believe in the sacredness of life because this child who is born taught me I believe in solidarity because this symbol taught me.",
          "Then I am a non-conformist and so let's say my non-conformism fortunately got the better of me so the message that I have on the eve of March 8th for the women of this nation is this:.",
          "Within this event on this day there are also international meetings, particularly with some leaders of the Western Balkans, another quadrant in which the government is very busy.",
          "But if we line up, our backs are much bigger than the powers that are attacking us.",
          "And thanks to the crowd that pressured the border guards of the German Democratic Republic to open the gates towards the west and a few minutes later danced joyfully on the ruins of that wall that we were able to embrace tens of millions of our brothers again in the common European ideal precisely to remember the events of one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine with law sixty-one of the fifteenth of April two thousand and five the Italian Republic declared November 9th, Freedom Day as the anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin Wall, a symbolic event for the liberation of oppressed nations and a hope for democracy for the populations still oppressed by totalitarianism.",
          "The way I see it, I believe that the solution is always, let's say, controls.",
          "HI.",
          "We have ninety-seven percent of workers covered by a contract that has been signed by at least one of the three main unions.",
          "But we have seen the results in the numbers, Mr Magi, of the policies you have carried out in recent years.",
          "The government has allocated over one billion euros for Regions and autonomous provinces, to limit the impact of payback in medical devices, on companies in the sector and to strengthen emergency rooms.",
          "Do you intend to intervene to modify the functioning of the super bonus as in the immediate future?",
          "I think masks continue to be useful, let's say the model of deprivation of freedoms that we have known in the past did not seem so effective to me and I think the Chinese case demonstrates this well.",
          "But that's not enough, we need to talk.",
          "Would like to further compete our cooperations in this regard.",
          "remaining silent about the denial of religious freedom is equivalent to being complicit in it.",
          "And I'm happy that finally those who, when they were in government, were unable to reverse this trend are realizing it..",
          "This is not the time for catwalks.",
          "I can have cash if I can't spend that cash legally I will tend to do it illegally, so the more you lower the ceiling on cash, the more you favor evasion, the more you raise the ceiling on cash, the less you favor evasion.",
          "HI.",
          "Therefore, the medium-term objective that the government has set itself is to overcome the logic of fragmented interventions by launching a large hydrogeological prevention plan.",
          "Because this taboo sometimes affects women too.",
          "On this let's say I prefer not to go into details, let's say spoil too much.",
          "And even more.",
          "For them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "Well, yes, there were quite a few.",
          "For goodness sake, even on a fixed-term basis, but new hires by companies.",
          "something new has been added in recent weeks, namely that this government has started its own.",

          "After that, in my opinion, the next step is to provide answers, no, to continue to work on the answers for which I already say a few days ago I had, speaking with Minister Piante Dosi, with the Undersecretary of Mantua, discussed the possibility of bringing together the Council of Ministers the next opportunity to give a sign of further attention certainly, but also of concreteness with respect to the steps that still need to be taken, here too I have heard Meloni is silent on this matter.",

          "After that, this story that is making the rounds makes me particularly laugh, so on this document notes for a conservative program practically this sentence is written, namely that young people will no longer be able to choose whether to work or not, but will be bound to accepting a job proposal for the loss of any benefit which has become a thing for which you, in short the jobs you have to do forced labor.",

          "If politics wants to ask for sacrifices, well, it must first demonstrate that it is willing to make them.",

          "But allow me to say that I also found very proud citizens who were at work and who said let's get back on our feet.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "In the sense leek that then the first possible negotiation point when we were talking about this topic of negotiation, even in this interview that I heard, reference was made to the fact that the State was actually negotiating the dismantling of the impediment prison of forty-one bis, of the quart- of the hard prison.",
          "And finally we deal with the work of people with disabilities, supporting the bodies that accompany them and allocating resources to encourage their hiring.",

          "If you get into difficulty you will be helped and not harassed.",
          "On the one hand we certainly have an enormous need to defend the competitiveness of our system, but not because the United States has angered the Infn Reduction Act, but because it is a moment in which we must question the choices that they have, for example in terms of supply chains, returned to controlling their own fundamental supply chains.",
          "your first.",
          "Thus one heart lights up another and millions of hearts are lit.",
          "For me now the priority is to confirm those measures for the whole of 2024, to see if we can do something more clearly for low incomes, for the pensioners most in difficulty, from the beginning we made the choice to concentrate the few resources on those who were more in difficulty, but at work, because this is also a cultural and multiplier signal that must be given.",
          "So today and until the end of this year, we have a cut in the contribution wedge of six percentage points for those with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros and even of seven percentage points for the lowest incomes of up to twenty-five thousand euros.",
          "It should have been done months ago, but some members, among the very presentable ones, according to a certain Europeanism, didn't want it because it wasn't convenient for them.",
          "and I am proud to lead this nation.",
          "It is a work that you have built and for which we have to thank you.",
          "We must always do more.",
          "I am thinking of the issue of excise duties and today we are allocating the entire amount of that treasure to the most important cut in labor taxes in recent decades.",
          "Starting tomorrow we must demonstrate our value.",
          "We want to maintain a system of protection for them, like the one that existed with the citizen's income, even trying to increase it, that is, to make it more dignified.",
          "This is a simple and responsible proposal that we intend to implement immediately, already in the next budget law.",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "Is this a question that might seem mean?",
          "And besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "It's why we are well-liked.",
          "Then they say no.",
          "to be faithful to the Republic, to loyally observe the Constitution and the laws and to exercise my mandate and my functions in the exclusive interest of the nation.",
          "How much does it cost?",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "With all the battle about safety in the workplace, the safety of workers, the safety of those who go out and participate in any initiative, food safety, why not this too?",
          "And then on the financing of summer centers to help reconcile life, work and family and on the subject of a single allowance for children and then the citizen's income as we promised.",
          "If politics demands that citizens be responsible, it must first demonstrate that it is responsible",
          "The government's sign of attention towards people who find themselves facing a difficult situation.",
          "So let's say about what has been done the most with a maximum threshold of forty thousand euros, which means that the measure is a measure aimed at the middle class.",
          "Above all, politics, a good part of politics, has been able to take advantage of your example.",
          "Since our first meeting last November, I have never stopped asking the question.",
          "In this we have always made the difference.",
          "What do you plan to do for employees?",
          "our work is a work that will see the Minister of Health as one of the important points of reference, who has personified, in these two years, what our choices mean in favor of the safety of citizens in favor of a safety that has guaranteed freedom in favor of a security that guaranteed freedom.",
          "let's postpone the entry into force of plastic taxes and taxes for another year which therefore will not come into force in two thousand and twenty three the other.",
          "Therefore, as you know from the beginning of its mandate, this government has concentrated most of its energy on the issue of salary management, on the issue of helping families.",
          "In these over two years I have never done an interview in the foreign press because I was in opposition to the government and I would not have spoken badly about my nation in the foreign press.",
          "Okay, so let's forget that cutting the tax wedge, money on families, money on the health fund, anything you can think of couldn't be done.",
          "And I continue to work on this.",
          "According to the principle of those who hire more, pay less taxes, this is an objective that we want to achieve during the legislature.",
          "Our position always remains the same.",
          "If in these first months we were obviously, how can I say it, in a centrifuge, no, that is, we took over the government at a very particular moment.",
          "Increases that can even reach one hundred euros for workers with the lowest incomes.",
          "And then many other matters ranging from the defense of our excellent food products onwards without us saying let's go into too much detail.",
          "We have chosen to be different from you, alternative to you.",
          "I made a very strong opposition, director, the confrontation of ideas didn't worry me or scare me.",
          "We are not victims of that prejudice, as long as we do not consider that the role that others have defined for us is also the role to which we can aspire.",
          "Instead it reached historic highs and failed as an active labor policy measure, given that very few of the recipients of the citizen's income were eventually hired and found a decent job.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "We are the coherence that has never been betrayed.",
          "So discourses that seem ideologically different come together precisely on this violent tone from conquerors to misogyny.",
          "In reality we don't want to abolish it.",
          "He learned that he should never give up.",
          "And so if someone expects not, do you feel a bit like Cinderella?",
          "Unfortunately I am the way I have been.",
          "We have ideas, legs, heart and will in this room outside of here I have to tell everyone don't underestimate us because we are a whim.",
          "And you know that this government is particularly committed to defending identity, culture and excellence.",
          "We confirm and indeed improve the support for those who cannot work, that is, for families in difficulty who have a minor, an elderly person or a disabled person within them.",
          "Look, people have very little money.",
          "We never fully realize it, probably because we are paradoxically addicted, not to the beauty and culture in which we are immersed.",
          "Because we have chosen to be who we are.",
          "And I find it frankly surreal.",
          "The work that we are doing here, that you are doing here is enormous work.",
          "And above all, let it be known that the only reason why we want to get to the top is that we know that from there we can look further.",
          "That is, we cannot uncritically support a process that on the altar of decarbonization leads us straight to deindustrialization.",
          "And what is the solution?",
          "In essence, the larger the family, the less taxes are paid, but we immediately intend to make an immediate tangible contribution to all families.",
          "The blanket was so short.",
          "But frankly, all the possible evil is attributed to the tones, the contents, the contrasts which seem to me to follow in tone the deadly anger of the other side, that is, Putin Kiril.",
          "I apologize for the addition of the protections guaranteed to workers, but a substitute parameter, a single parameter, and in our system a parameter of this type would risk, paradoxically, creating worse conditions for many workers than those they have today and paradoxically doing them a favor to large economic concentrations in which it is appropriate to review workers' rights downwards.",
          "I think of the disabled.",
          "We are a whim of history and politics.",
          "No, our sense of belonging, the awareness of the community that we are, of the value that that community has a nation in which we said yesterday in the conference of ambassadors, when we go outside our own national borders we realize how much we we are considered the only place where we don't realize how much we are considered.",
          "I believe it is effective to cut taxes on labor, because the reason why wages are inadequate is that taxation is too high for the companies that have to hire them and work to combat discrimination and irregularities.",
          "But in short, I wanted to give this signal.",
          "And do you spend the day insulting or mystifying?",
          "And I think it is a job on which everyone must involve.",
          "Anyone who wants to work with us is welcome.",
          "President Meloni, we immediately approve a minimum wage and equal leave.",
          "We have started important work to make the places that our students frequent more modern and then again on young people, from the culture card to the Merit Card, in favor respectively of the kids with the lowest ISEE and the deserving ones up to the increase of the sports in the suburbs, passing through the five hundred million allocated to scholarships for university housing allocations, we have reiterated the principle that equality and merit are one prerequisite for the other from the provision to simplify the first thirty administrative procedures up to the highly anticipated reform of the procurement code we have started a profound revision to make the State more streamlined, more understandable, more efficient.",
          "on Labor Day the government chooses to work, chooses to work to provide answers to those workers and to those who legitimately aspire to improve their condition.",
          "So we are already working on the budget law.",
          "In short, having been in parliament for a few years, I also know that when political signals have to be given, they are given on secondary things, they are not given on things that are objectively not, that is, this bad image for us, but not for us, only government, in short for everyone, so I really think it was superficiality that I can't say whether it's better or worse, but it's certainly something that can be remedied.",
          "But since the issue of support for working mothers and the issue of support for the birth rate is an absolute priority for us, I am always available to discuss and talk about this.",
          "So this is the reality of things.",
          "It's not what role others have decided for you.",
          "And this seems to me to be one of those cases.",
          "The question is whether you accept it.",
          "For this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",
          "Budget law.",
          "We chose to do a difficult campaign because those themes were complex, they were more difficult to localize.",
          "She replies She goes alone, there is the risk that she goes alone faced with the fact that she tells me I don't talk to Savini for a week, this doesn't depend on me.",
          "In short, we hope to do what we can, adding at this point also your personal commitment, you know, you know?",
          "Let's say for culture, as they say, we want to abolish it etc.",
          "We will continue to work.",
          "she regretted not having cut fuel excise duties.",
          "look, as you said, the general picture is quite complex.",
          "We talk about all this, we look for our proposals, we do things, we question ourselves, we compare ourselves, etc.",
          "The State, as you know, intervenes to reduce bills for families up to now with a maximum of twelve thousand euros of ISEE, we bring the twelve thousand euros to fifteen thousand euros of ISEE.",
          "In these moments I am always quite focused on the objective.",
          "obviously beyond the issue of respect for international law, the value of sovereignty and freedom of a nation.",
          "In this year and more in which we have continued to make this proposal to the government, the proposal has never been implemented.",
          "Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen to seven point four, that is, the lowest level in the last fourteen years and therefore at the end of all the really interesting data is that those who have found a job since the beginning of the year.",
          "Widespread petty crime, violence, open-air drug dealing, baby gangs, streets, squares, sometimes entire neighborhoods completely abandoned to decay and removed from state control, often handed over to the putrid rules of the mafia and organized crime.",
          "but it is a nation that equally needs such a government, a government of free people, a government of people who have no masters, a government of people who cannot be blackmailed, a government of people who cannot be bought , of go, of a government made up of people who do not respond to a system of power.",
          "Rich individuals in expensive suits say it, professors who have never left the good neighborhoods of big cities.",
          "So it's time to say enough to these distorted mechanisms.",
          "Do you consider it a hypothesis?",
          "In short, a captivating title, a result that risks being counterproductive.",
          "We are the first green agriculture in Europe, we possess a heritage of typicality, quality, food safety, care of the territory which must absolutely be protected and valorised.",

          "This is the reason why we did not vote for the opposition proposal.",
          "First of all because many probably expected a little Italy, spaghetti and mandolin which, when faced with difficulties, always turns the other way in the end and instead we have been something else, we are something else and look at this, it's not just a fact of pride is a matter of defense of the national interest, because when you are authoritative, when you are credible your voice is also listened to and when your voice is listened to then yes you can obtain results for your national interest.",
          "But this is a job that in the end you build day by day, more than politics, more than that, obviously.",
          "Amounts too low.",
          "That is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",

          "It's true, it's true, there is a problem: those who have governed until now have unfortunately made Italian workers poorer.",
          "Perhaps for this reason, Brothers of Italy continues to do well.",
          "The results once again disprove the predictions and make us responsible to do more and more, to do better, aware as we are that a strong and credible Italy outside national borders means above all an Italy capable of affirming the interests and needs of its citizens.",
          "This instability has produced our economic weakness, it has produced the credibility problems that we may have also had at an international level, when our interlocutors often remain the same interlocutor for at least a few years and every time they sit with an Italian exponent they ask themselves the next once again, who knows if this person will be my interlocutor again on the part of Italy and they have produced the disaffection on the part of the citizens that we see and to deliver to Italy a reform which, let's be clear, we are doing for ourselves, because it is a reform which we hand over to the next government and therefore we hand over to all the political forces.",

          "It is not normal that different social safety nets still exist in Italy between employees and self-employed workers.",
          "The left rises up because according to them the publication of that video is a violation of the dignity of the victim, now given that I took that video from one of the main Italian newspapers, given that since I am very attentive to these things, I published that video only and exclusively because no one was seen, in reality no one is recognised, the victim is not recognised, the video is substantially blacked out.",
          "And this is usually what people do like this I and the government went as you know, in Calabria on the same day and this tragedy happened the government is me.",
          "An instability that penalizes Italians because governments that last so short do not have a long-term vision, they always and only seek easy and immediate consensus.",
          "Okay, Italy is lost.",
          "If we looked at the OECD data on the trend of average wages, we would realize that for over thirty years the salaries of Italians in real terms have been practically frozen.",
          "But there is a problem that when the state does something it is never free, because the money it spends is taxpayers' money and therefore when it spends money it puts it on one side and takes it away from the other.. Do you know how much it cost for every single Italian, around two thousand euros, just under two thousand euros?",
          "for Italy in recent years we always said yesterday no on development cooperation, that is, when there is no water there are those who bring bottles of water and there are those who bring a dinner, that is, those who want to leave the autonomy the freedom of the nations in which it cooperates, so that that nation can grow and the sign of Italian cooperation has always been like this.",
          "And I also thank Matteo and Antonio who wanted to be here this morning, our two deputy prime ministers.",
          "The cup is handed over to Simone Giannelli And here we have a photographer who obscures us.",
          "I hear Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio say today that if the center-right wins, Italy risks an economic war.",
          "Today it is in the budget, so I announce that anyone who wants to open a business in Italy will have to do so following the rules and there will no longer be children from Serie A and children from Serie B.",
          "From the undertaking with him, Italy learned that it should never have limits imposed on it.",
          "Because the other thing, which makes me a little angry, Nicola, is it possible that we never manage to celebrate, is it possible that we always have to flagellate ourselves that when the Italian state, finally in a moment in which we have a thousand problems, can claim victory?",
          "In Italy, however, perhaps it is not even as difficult as some think.",
          "It is a measure that obviously impacts state coffers today, because where there is a creditor there is also a debtor and that debtor is the Italian taxpayers.",
          "I simply think that the problem of the left is that it is a bit short on arguments and you know why it is short on arguments it is short on arguments because we, by governing, are dismantling the narrative of an unpresentable right, of an authoritarian right , of a right incapable of governing and we are demonstrating in Italy and beyond national borders that it can exist instead.",
          "In short, the Council of Ministers, the government are there, the other institutional levels are also there, there is a level of collaboration here which is very precious in a situation like this, it was a tragedy, but we can always be reborn from crises strong and therefore it can also be an opportunity to demonstrate how concrete and immediate Italy knows how to be in terms of damage estimates.",
          "Brothers of Italy has already filed in the past and will do so again.",
          "So yes, in Italy there is a serious problem of low wage levels.",
          "Perhaps you have some difficulty in explaining to Italians why in a moment like this, in a moment in which we are heading towards a dramatic autumn on a social, economic and cost-of-living level, you are dealing with a matter which, first of all, is not priority at this moment and second point?",
          "What doesn't work in the system is this instability, because a short government horizon corresponds to a short-term policy.",
          "That is the Italy that we want to see and live again in which we want to be protagonists again.",
          "Simone Giannelli prepares Beautiful Italy is world champion The fourth title for ours, for our boys, for our national team, for the seriousness, for the light-heartedness, for the talent dedicated to an entire country dedicated to you Italians truly for It's a joy for us, because we've really been waiting for it for a long time.",
          "All seasoned by Giuseppe Conte who arrives on Saturday evening on television at eight o'clock on unified networks and tells you what your rights are.",
          "This is why I am even more convinced today that a conservative turn is needed in the West, in the United States, in Europe, in Italy..",
          "It is a battle in which Italy continued with determination and this led to the end, despite there being great resistance to bring the whole of Europe to a proposal that in short we were among the first, if not the first, to do, which is a huge signal for Italian and European families and businesses and shows that in short, when you take a little with determination and a little stubbornness the results can come.",
          "So you have to look for the symbol of the brothers of Italy, make a cross on both cards, fold the cards and you have made the revolution",
          "What I can say is that a centre-right government led by the brothers of Italy would do everything it could to continue this process and to allow Chico to at least finally be able to see his daughter.",
          "We are working on this thanks to the position of the Italian government.",
          "We ask Speranza to answer why he never wanted to consider the more serious proposal that had been made to him.",
          "Partly due to an ideological approach, because security, after all, for them is a right-wing thing, state intervention is needed immediately, now the restoration of security and legality and the fight against degradation are among the priorities of the brothers of Italy, starting from greater control of the territory.",
          "today Bologna with Patrizia making tortellini by hand, one by one in the window, a fantastic thing and she taught me.",
          "And I believe that that homeland, in days like these, must be there to say, to tell you that the credibility, the pride, the reliability that Italy can boast in the world which make it respected, respectable, richer, walk on your legs, on your example and on your sacrifices.",
          "On the symbol of the brothers of Italy we mean the party and you have voted now, however, keep in mind that compared to how you see it here the symbol will not necessarily be here or here because it changes in all the constituencies.",
          "Brothers of Italy has worked and will continue to work hard in this sense to guarantee agriculture the support it deserves, because our land is our true wealth",
          "Long live Italy!",
          "In this disastrous situation, what will be the concern of the government press and Italian politics will be to give answers to families and businesses that have been on their knees for days now, the most discussed topic by the media and politics.",
          "But I tell you even if there was a proportional law with today's numbers, sorry Giletti, then we'll see when we go to vote, maybe brothers of Italy have five percent.",
          "I consider it a maneuver, consistent with the commitments that we have made with the Italian people.",
          "Micheletto!",
          "Tomorrow Patrick Zaki will return to Italy and I wish him, from the bottom of my heart, a life of serenity and success.",
          "So I want to help Italian brothers grow.",
          "as a national team.",
          "I didn't know the other two interlocutors.",
          "In this perspective, Brothers of Italy has always proposed a radical paradigm shift in the tax system so that income taxation takes into account the composition and characteristics of families with the introduction of the so-called family quotient.",
          "I am black, my daughter Giorgia and I am saying that Giorgio is a masterpiece.",
          "And which can be projected from now to the political elections it will be difficult to do without brothers of Italy in the pro- in the next legislature.",
          "And what I'm doing with brothers from Italy.",
          "And in any case, Italy will continue to support today and obviously intends to be a protagonist in the possible future reconstruction of the country.",
          "Here, the objective of this government is to have rather than more Europe in Italy, more Italy in Europe, in a condition of equal dignity with the member states, as befits a great founding nation, it means not limiting oneself to ratifying the downstream choices, but to contribute to defining those choices upstream, to make the VOC, the voice of our nation, heard strongly, to direct European integration towards more effective responses to the great challenges of our time and towards a more attentive approach to the needs of citizens, families and businesses.",
          "And for me this is a very important element, because the Italian government's approach completely changes compared to what we have seen in recent years.",
          "Gianmarco, No, stop it!",
          "with Gianni Forti, uncle of Chico Forti, an affair that Brothers of Italy has been following for many years for this Italian who we are fighting so that he can return to Italy and here we are doing the impossible to try to bring him back here.",
          "Italy is a nation that is looked at with great respect, with great attention and which in my opinion, even today, thanks to its non-hesitant posture which allows it to play an important role in Europe too, is looked at with even greater attention.",
          "We will do it for all Italians.",
          "Everything we have to give we must give to the Italians because we have always believed in the Italians and we were not wrong.",
          "No, they do it right, Alfredo.",
          "And a system that gives stability to the government, an institutional system worthy of a great Western nation like Italy to return to being protagonists in Europe and in the world to return to investing in our future, to return to growth and prosperity",
          "Everyone in Rome is organizing it at Meloni's, we have nothing, we just have to steal.",
          "Italy is not afraid of young people who want not to have to escape from their land.",
          "So I turn to free Italians, be aware of the fact that this game that is being played on my skin is actually being played to cheat you, because until we return to elections they will do everything to tarnish us, to prevent people from opposing the policies of this government, to prevent people from voting the way they don't want.",
          "I'm not the one saying it and so there's something that doesn't add up when the prime minister comes to the chamber again yesterday and responding to a question time from the brothers of Italy says Taxes won't increase because you wrote it, you're doing it to increase taxes.",
          "Think about the effect that something like this has on hundreds and thousands of companies in Italy, forcing employees to lose their jobs, to go on layoffs which means earning less on salaries that have already been lowered by inflation.",
          "The paradox is Italy and so maybe it's worth it, right?",
          "Where is the victory Enrico Letta.",
          "This means that obviously those who have cash to spend, perhaps foreigners, prefer to go and do it in other countries, because it cannot be done in Italy.. Then on the topic of tax evasion this too is unfortunately tragically contradicted by the numbers.",
          "Then I call it black Argentina guys.",
          "Boldrini yes, in my opinion it isn't.",

          "Just what's the difference?",
          "Which historically we say is easier for them to hide where they grew up.",
          "Which First Nations provide assistance?",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "A series of names you just have to make a cross.",
          "We need rules to prevent that in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",
          "Then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the Mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "It looks like a Lancia y with the four position indicators lit that was trumpeting and trying to make its way through the intense city traffic.",
          "That is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",
          "The causes are multiple, we obviously know the political instability, economic crises which are obviously aggravated by the international conflict and last but not least I continue to denounce the interests of powerful criminal trafficking organizations which often have transnational projections.",
          "the immigration issue.",

          "The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",
          "Well, starting next week we are working on new rules to stop trafficking, because we don't intend to give up on this issue.",
          "The decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",
          "The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.",
          "Clear information on rescue mechanisms is needed.",

          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "It is done by allowing them to have a job, a decent job, a well-paid job that can help them grow regardless of the condition from which they come.",
          "International law provides something very clear: you are obliged to save someone if you accidentally meet them and if someone is at risk.",
          "It means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "Preventing people from having fun as I have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",

          "You see, President, when there is a war it is the women and children who flee, the men tend to stay and fight.",
          "We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",

          "Because it being understood that what we know is what you heard from Undersecretary Mantovani regarding this matter, these people, were not in a position to be saved by someone who did not want to save them, as unfortunately it seems to me that some people want to say.",
          "What this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",

          "It was difficult to imagine that there was such awareness on this matter on the part of the European Council.",
          "The Standing memorandum, that is the memorandum of understanding that we signed with the prime minister on AC and with the United Kingdom, is something that several governments have tried to work on before there is also a very good feeling between us.",
          "I intervened, I responded to interviews, I wrote a letter to the European Council and the European Commission.",
          "A transition which, as we have always said and forcefully reiterated in Europe, is indispensable, but must be done with criteria.",
          "And it's not an imposition by the Americans, it's a European choice and it's a wrong choice, because if we are convinced that clearly the destiny of the West as a whole is inextricably linked, well we are equally convinced that not always from one on the other side of the Atlantic the interests are perfectly overlapping.",
          "Having said this, and obviously I feel I can say that the Def will be approved by Parliament in the next few days and hours and that we will keep our commitments, including that of presenting it in Europe by April 30th.",
          "It is better if it is done in agreement with all the EU states, but it can in any case also be done at a national level.",

          "It is thanks to the spiritual, political and diplomatic work of a saint and a statesman like John Paul II, who said that Europe must breathe with two lungs, the Western one and the Eastern one.",
          "It is possible that we are able to do something that might be unthinkable even in Europe.",

          "I want to be clear about one thing, what we are inaugurating today is above all a dialogue between equals based on mutual respect, because the relationship between Europe and the wider Mediterranean cannot be a relationship, let's say competitive, or even conflictual.. Then I want to be the first to be frank.",
          "As you know, in recent weeks and at the last meeting of the European Council, important steps forward have been made, to which concrete solutions must be given today, obviously in the shortest time possible.. And then, obviously, we talked about the resources of how to best spend the resources of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, as well as in the face of the difficulties that exist, increase in the costs of raw materials, inflation.",
          "This means firmly combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, it means protecting those who have the right to international protection and managing legal immigration in an orderly manner through flow decrees.. All within a framework of responsibility that must also involve the other European states.",

          "So for this reason, as I said before, we intend to follow the path of technological neutrality and we are doing so firmly, but also with a proactive spirit at a European level.",
          "For the first time in Europe, meetings are held and documents emerge in which it is said that the central Mediterranean route is a priority.",

          "Families and entrepreneurs are increasingly resorting to usurious credit, because the banks, immobilized by regulations that are too stringent, are actually unable to respond to the current demand for credit.",
          "At the same time it should also facilitate the transfer by companies that find themselves burdened by credits that have remained closed in their tax drawers.",
          "We must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "But it's obvious that for goodness' sake, if you take someone's credit and you haven't even gone to check whether not only the work has been done, but whether the property exists as happened, you are co-responsible because in short, a minimum of control should done, but if you couldn't have known some things.",
          "Instead we want to push as much as possible banks, companies and all the actors involved to allow the acquisition of credits that are already at a standstill, those so-called stranded credits, i.e.",
          "To dispose of these credits.",

          "Because in all of this, since there have been many scams in this matter, obviously those who have to acquire the credit are afraid of being co-responsible for anyone who may have generated a scam.",
          "However, unfortunately this has not always happened and we are therefore recording record profits from many banking institutions.",
          "A reform of the anti-usury law is needed to overcome delays and bureaucratic cumbersomeness that until now have hindered the submission of complaints by victims.",
          "You cannot assign the credit you have generated to another actor.",
          "For this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",

          "Which means that if we left the transferability of those credits throughout this year, at the end of this year we would have at least another forty million euros.",
          "Trace who had generated that credit now you understand that such a system lends itself a little to scams and also lends itself a little to creating, no, a bubble that increases this mechanism.",
          "This change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "But the second and more complex question concerns the fact that the super bonus created by the then Giallorossi government envisaged the possibility that the credit I had when I was doing the work towards the State could be transferable.",
          "On the other hand we said that in the future it will no longer be possible to exceed those credits.",
          "But above all because obviously those who have to take out a loan prefer to do so on a new loan rather than an old one.",
          "We have made a rule that allows us to say Don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
          "The first is that we do not allow the purchase of those credits by the Public Administration, therefore regions and municipalities, because some were gearing up, obviously in an attempt to find a solution to do so, but there is a problem that these credits have practically generated a sort of parallel currency and that parallel currency risks impacting public budgets in a devastating way.",
          "Because it is obvious that if I have to put ten percent of what I am spending I will be more careful, more careful to look at how much I spend and to see if, for example, prices have not in some cases increased for no reason.",

          "Because they are so strong with the weak and weak, with the strong ceiling on gas in Europe immediately.",
          "what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes.",
          "What is written in the Brothers of Italy program is sterilization, that is, if the price rises beyond a certain threshold, the State earns in excess of excise duties and VAT it uses to lower the price.",
          "That is, we have not limited ourselves to explaining the good reasons that lead us to believe that the proposed regulation on codue emissions for light vehicles is inappropriate in its current form with the deadline of 2035 that we know we have illustrated, data in hand, that the same result can be achieved.",
          "Obviously the international question, the crisis in Ukraine, the the domino, so to speak, of consequences, which therefore obviously produces the issue of the need to give concreteness to a European solution on the issue of rising costs as soon as possible of energy on the topic of a note on a cap on the price of gas that was discussed.",
          "The decrease in the cost of energy is favoring production, encouraging companies to start hiring again and it was therefore certainly the right choice to continue the battle for the introduction of a European ceiling on the price of gas",
          "Now here is something that needs to be explained everyone all the petrol stations in Italy are required to communicate to the institutions if they make price changes some do not make these communications.",
          "The European Union suddenly found itself hostage to Russian blackmail on gas and harnessed to an energy pricing mechanism that actually encourages speculation.",
          "So the priority is to immediately set a price for gas at European level so that speculation can finally be blocked and this would immediately lower bills.",
          "And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.",
          "After that, there is certainly an intervention that needs to be done with regards to the motorway network, where sometimes the price is can be significantly higher by virtue of the concessions, because sometimes in service stations the motorway manager gives a sub concession and in this passage sometimes some rules are skipped and therefore I think that on this too we need to make the concessionaires responsible for future concessions to monitor what happens.",
          "That is, you have to know when you go to get petrol, whether where you are getting petrol compared to what the average does, let's say for all the others, is convenient for you or not, because this automatically helps us to fight some of those who may be the not many.",
          "Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days.",
