In late August 2022, Counterspin founder Alp and co-host Spierer were arrested in Christchurch on charges of distributing an objectionable publication, and for failing to allow Police to search their computer. The pair had allegedly distributed footage of the 2019 Christchurch mosque 


shootings. Alp and Spierer were subsequently bailed and ordered to appear at the Christchurch District Court on 30 August.[4] During the hearing on 31 August, the pair refused to enter the dock and instead read prepared statements from the lawyer's bench. After ignoring Judge Large's repeated instructions to stand in the dock, Alp and Spierer were forcibly removed by security personnel and remanded on bail for three weeks. 60 protesters supporting Counterspin Media and a smaller group of counter-demonstrators demonstrated outside the Christchurch District Court.[12] The pair subsequently reappeared at the Christchurch District Court in December 2022
