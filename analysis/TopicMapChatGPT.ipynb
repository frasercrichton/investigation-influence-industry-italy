       " 'We have collected the main one hundred, one hundred actions in one hundred days from the measures against the mafia, such as the maintenance of the impediment prison up to the fight against illegality also done with carpet checks in the stations and starting the procedures for over ten thousand hirings in the police forces order.',\n",
       " 'We have brought about a change of pace for the State in combating illegality from the fight against illegal immigration, with the decree on NGOs, the recognition by the European Union of the need to address the problem in a structural way, as requested by Italy up to the management of legal immigration, setting the quotas of those who can come to work in Italy respecting the rules.',\n",
       " 'We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.',\n",

       " 'From the extension of the Solidarity Fund for mortgages and the guarantee fund for the purchase of the first home for young couples, through to the rule that allows everyone to transform the variable rate mortgage into a fixed rate mortgage, we have given a hand in defending the right to housing from the fiscal truce to the extension of the flat tax for self-employed and VAT numbers, up to the cut in taxation on productivity bonuses and on the highest declared incomes, through the tax relief on tips and the extension of the suspension on Plastic and Sugar Tax, we have begun to build a state that is friendlier to those who produce, from raising the ceiling to the use of cash to the norm to combat open-and-close companies.',\n",
       " 'We have also begun to combat tax evasion where tax evasion really lurks from the increase in resources for healthcare to the national oncology plan, through the release of seventy-seven million intended to support people with autism spectrum disorder for rule that allows deserving disabled students not to have to give up their disability allowance.',\n",

       " 'We chose to do a difficult campaign because those themes were complex, they were more difficult to localize.',\n",
       " 'Yet in every southern city our squares were full, because even in the south there is a desire to hope, there is a desire to hope for real change, there is a desire to escape from the condition of marginality, there is a desire to believe that decline is not a destiny, it is a choice.',\n",
       " 'Others choose to govern the decline, we have chosen to fight.',\n",

       " \"Part of these resources are recovered from a redefinition of the rule on extra profits which should overcome, let's say, some of the elements that were at the basis of the disputes that were raised and allow us to recover around two and a half billion.\",\n",
       " 'Also because we raise the rate on extra profits from twenty-five to thirty-five percent.',\n",
       " 'This maneuver reserves a lot of attention to the productive fabric.',\n",

       " 'We apply a flat tax of fifteen percent on the highest profit earned.',\n",
       " \"So let's say about what has been done the most with a maximum threshold of forty thousand euros, which means that the measure is a measure aimed at the middle class.\",\n",
       " \"It is not a measure to favor the rich, there is an increase in the flat tax to fifteen percent for the self-employed, which until now was linked to a turnover of, let's say, sixty-five thousand euros and is being raised to eighty-five thousand and there is for the employee jobs.\",\n",
       " 'A flat tax of up to five percent on productivity bonuses of up to three thousand euros is the cut in the tax wedge.',\n",

       " 'The um measures for the facilitation of the purchase of the first home for young couples are confirmed, of which there are two, one relating to the registration tax and the other is the guarantee that the State covers up to eighty percent on mortgages for the first home for young couples and there is a measure that in my opinion is very important regarding parental leave.',\n",
       " \"You know that net of compulsory leave, the optional leave that can be used up to six years of the child's life is paid at thirty percent.\",\n",

       " \"the possibility of retiring at sixty-two with forty-one years of contributions, but also here with some common sense guidelines, the most important of which is that for those who decide eh , let's say you enter this window um until you meet the requirements you will not be able to take a pension greater than five times the minimum.\",\n",
       " 'We have also decided to help minimum pensions.',\n",
       " 'Now we will revalue pensions, we will revalue all pensions according to indexation, but we will do it with a different percentage based on how high the pension is.',\n",
       " 'That is, we have decided that minimum pensions are revalued not by one hundred percent, but by one hundred percent.',\n",
       " \"So the biggest increase in relation to let's say inflation will be the lowest pensions, all pensions up to two thousand euros and above are revalued by one hundred percent.\",\n",

       " 'It is exactly from this philosophy that we move um we would obviously have needed more time to carry out an overall reform which we will do on this matter in a month we were not in a position to do it, but in the meantime, faithful to our principles, we establish that we continue to protect those who cannot work, disabled people, elderly people, families without income with dependent minors.',\n",

       " 'Um why did we make this choice?',\n",
       " 'We made this choice because obviously, not having yet put in place all the tools with which we want to transform assistance into work, we have given ourselves a transitional period to accompany our choices.',\n",
