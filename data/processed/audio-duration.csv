Excellent news that pushes us to always do better.","51":"Serving the Nation for 100 years.

Italy and Europe can no longer remain under the blackmail of unscrupulous smugglers, who use migrants as human shields for their trafficking, nor allow these criminals to decide who can arrive on our shores and who cannot. We will move forward on this because it is the only way to stop deaths at sea, protect the weakest and guarantee safety","57":"We do not intend to replicate the approach of those who have let human traffickers operate undisturbed. Our response against these criminal smugglers will be even more firm and determined.","58":"The point is not what role others have decided for you, the point is whether you accept it: this must make the difference. Always. Today I spoke at the presentation of the new layout of the Women's Room at the Chamber of Deputies, in view of March 8th.","59":"I have heard and read some frankly surreal reconstructions about the Cutro tragedy. I'll explain what happened and what the Government intends to do. Listen.","60":"It was an honor for me to inaugurate this year's Raisina Dialogue, and to do so in front of such an extraordinary audience. An audience that includes representatives from across the G20, with whom Italy shares a special responsibility to find solutions to our common global challenges. We are weathering a terrible storm that is making it difficult for our ships to navigate. But now we can make a difference.","61":"I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the wonderful welcome in India. A trip that coincides with the 75th Anniversary of bilateral relations between our Nations, which we have elevated to Strategic Partnership.","62":"On 1 March 1961 the National Acrobatic Team was born in Rivolto. Since then, the Frecce Tricolori of the Italian Air Force have been flying over our skies with extraordinary aerobatics.

I present to you my interview from a little while ago with Bruno Vespa on \"Cinque Minuti\".","65":"The era in which the State turns the other way on the legality front is over: for this reason, among the many operations on the topic, the Government has started its battle against illegal occupations. Here are some facts #gliappuntidigiorgia","66":"Building bonuses: here are the Government's measures.","67":"Palazzo Chigi, today. In memory of the Martyrs of the Foibe and the exiles of Istria, Fiume and Dalmatia.","68":"I am very happy with the results obtained by Italy in this European Council. There were those who thought that Italian foreign policy consisted only of getting pats on the back, whereas today we have demonstrated that the interests of the nation have international relevance. First of all on the topic of migrants, where a very important principle that will change the approach has finally been put down in black and white: immigration is an EU problem and needs an EU response.","69":"Press point in Brussels for the extraordinary European Council.","70":"100 shares in 100 days","71":"Behind the arrest of Matteo Messina Denaro there are brave men and women who worked every day giving up so much of their lives and who deserve gratitude and respect. When the State wins against organized crime we must be happy, because it means that the mafia can be defeated.","72":"Today is a day of celebration for women and men who, silently, 7 days a week, 365 days a year dedicate their lives to the fight against the mafia. I want to tell them that they can count on the Government's measures to carry on this battle together.","73":"A beautiful day for all of Italy. The nation is proud of you.","74":"With determination and with our heads held high, we will revive Italy. Together.","75":"My interview this evening on Tg5. Here you can see it again.","76":"For several days some commentators and opposition members have been saying that the price of petrol would reach \u20ac2.50. However, the data tells us that this is not the case. Let's discover them together.","77":"Petrol costs: here are the Government's interventions to counter possible speculation.","78":"Illegal immigration and human trafficking: the end of Italy that attacks those who respect the rules and pretends not to see those who systematically violate them. #gliappuntidigiorgia","79":"To you, to your families, happy 2023.","80":"Jobs are created by companies and the State cannot eradicate poverty by decree. We are working to put Italian companies in a position to hire, thus promoting the growth of the entire nation. It is our commitment.","81":"On Covid, the restrictive model adopted in the past did not work, as we are also seeing in China. My idea is that we need to work on empowering citizens and on prevention, rather than on the deprivation of freedoms. And I intend to continue like this in the future too.","82":"In Erbil, to bring the nation's thanks to the Italian soldiers who carry out their work every day with a great spirit of self-sacrifice and sacrifice. Furthermore, I am truly grateful for the gifts with which they honored me: the Tricolor with the signatures of all the soldiers present and the magnificent mosaic of my image in which each card is made up of photographs of the Italian soldiers of the contingent in Iraq. An immense honor.","83":"In Iraq to meet the Italian military contingent and send them our gratitude and Christmas greetings. Thanks to Major General Iannucci and the soldiers who gave me the camouflage and thanks to Marshal Meloni for giving me the tag with his (and my) surname, which I wore with immense pride.","84":"The agreement reached in Europe on the gas price cap is a great victory for Italy.","85":"This video was shot 5 years ago. But I haven't changed my mind and so I'll tell you again. It is still the time of the Nativity scene revolution.","86":"Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Soon \"Giorgia's notes in the square\", live on my social channels.","87":"The Government's position on immigration always remains the same: Italy cannot be entered illegally. For the first time in Europe the topic is actually being addressed. We don't intend to give up. #gliappuntidigiorgia","88":"Saturday, 5.30 pm, #gliappuntidigiorgia in Piazza del Popolo. Appointment in Rome for the event dedicated to 10 years of Fratelli d'Italia.","89":"In the past we have always wondered whether there should be more or less Europe in Italy. The objective of our Government, however, is for there to be more Italy in Europe, directing the latter towards a more attentive approach to the needs of citizens, families and businesses.","90":"18app: after the specious controversies of recent days, I will explain to you what we will do and why we do not want to remove incentives from culture for young people, if anything improve them. #gliappuntidigiorgia","91":"The touching words of the two carabinieri who escorted a one-year-old boy in cardiac arrest to hospital, stuck in traffic with his parents, saving his life. The emotion that shines through their testimony tells of the sense of duty and passion that many men and women in uniform use every day for the good of the community. Our gratitude to them.","92":"Work can take you anywhere, while citizenship income leaves you where you are. And we have chosen to believe in Italy and Italians. #Giorgia'snotes","93":"Cash limit, fight against tax evasion and unfair competition. Everything you need to know about the Government's initiatives. #Giorgia'snotes","94":"Today at the Civil Protection headquarters to receive updates and stay in contact with the operational offices that are providing aid in Ischia. I renew our gratitude to the institutions, which immediately mobilized, and to all the heroic rescuers who are working incessantly to help the populations affected by the bad weather.","95":"#Maneuver2023","96":"Today and tomorrow in Bali to participate in the #G20Indonesia and important bilateral meetings. Faced with the challenges of our time, we need to dialogue and work together to find solutions to global crises.","97":"After intense diplomatic work, today our compatriot Alessia Piperno was released by the Iranian authorities and is preparing to return to Italy. I want to thank everyone who helped bring Alessia back to her family.","98":"The demolition of the Berlin Wall marks the decline of Soviet communism and, with it, of the totalitarian regimes that had dominated twentieth-century Europe. 33 years after that event, let's not forget the value of democracy and freedom, founding values \u200b\u200bof our identity.","99":"Illegal raves: Italy is over, where some respect the rules and others don't.","100":"I wanted to organize this first Government visit to Brussels to give the signal of an Italy that wants to participate, collaborate and defend its national interest within the European dimension, bringing the best solutions together with other Nations on the great challenges we are facing .","101":"Today the swearing-in of the Undersecretaries. The task entrusted to them will be difficult and full of obstacles, but I am sure that they will be ready to carry out it with seriousness, commitment and dedication. For the future of Italy and Italians.","102":"At the Altare della Patria, to lay a laurel wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. We pay homage to all those who sacrificed their lives for the nation. A past to be honored and passed on to new generations, day after day, to build Italy's future together.","103":"At the end of this adventure, only one thing will interest me: knowing that we have done everything we could to give Italians a better nation. Rest assured that we will not give up, we will not retreat, and we will not betray.","104":"It begins. With a lot of emotion but also with the awareness of the difficult challenges that await us. Now it's our turn: we are ready \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9","105":"Oath at the Quirinale","106":"The centre-right delegation agreed with President Mattarella on the need to give the nation a new #Government in the shortest possible time.

We are ready.","107":"Statements after consultations with the President of the Republic","108":"Professionals, teachers, economists, representatives of the territories, administrators, men and women who will give heart and soul to defend the interests and rights of the Italian people.

We are ready: now is your time. #VoteFdI","113":"In the #South, as throughout Italy, there is a desire for real change. And we are ready to restore a future and hope to our land.","114":"Now it's your turn","115":"Favorable polls are nice but they shouldn't distract us: to win we must first complete the battles. On September 25th we need a great mobilization: we must all go and vote. The broader the consensus for #fratelliditalia, the less chance our adversaries will have of getting together after the 2022 #politicalelections to mess up and play palace games... bypassing, once again, the popular will.","116":"Thanks Rome!","117":"Piazza del Popolo (Rome) now. What a show!","118":"Do you know the latest one? Some exponents of the left and of the M5S, probably annoyed by yet another participatory square for #fratelliditalia, began to spread the ridiculous #hoax on social media that I had made a #photomontage of our demonstration in Palermo, spreading a simple image taken with a wide angle . Now who can explain to him that on my page there is, in addition to several photos, the live broadcast of my speech where the square packed with people was filmed for an hour? Evidently, it bothers some that Fratelli d'Italia has filled squares throughout Italy, from north to south. P.S. On this occasion we also dedicate these beautiful video images of the square to him \ud83d\ude18","119":"Bologna, handmade tortellini lesson by Patrizia and Lisa: Italian excellence and local pride. What do you think, did I get away with it? I'll get better.","120":"Little is said about it, but in Italy there is a #usury emergency, a phenomenon that is crushing families and entrepreneurs. Here is our commitment to help those honest citizens who have fallen victim to criminal credit","121":"September 25th is approaching. You are ready? #VoteFdI","122":"The same rules that exist on other media must apply on social networks. Freedom of speech and transparency in the management of our data cannot be questioned: we proposed it from the opposition and we will do it to the Government.","123":"Supporting the most vulnerable and giving a prospect of work and well-being to everyone else: we will leave no one behind. Here's what we want to do with #citizenshipincome. Listen.","124":"I have a complaint to make. Listen carefully\u2026","125":"At the rhythm of the square. Long live Bari","126":"Postcard for Michele Emiliano. Thanks Bari \u2665\ufe0f","127":"Ready to protect superbonus rights and improve construction subsidies. Always on the side of businesses and honest citizens who work hard to make Italy grow and improve. Here are the proposals of Fratelli d'Italia #votafdi","128":"Voting is simple: just cross the Fratelli d'Italia symbol. We are ready to lift Italy up, now it's your turn. #VoteFdI","129":"I will be clear once again: there is no possibility that #fratelliditalia will go to Government with the Democratic Party. We fight their hegemony of power and it certainly won't be absurd journalistic reconstructions that will change our minds.","130":"Let's clarify (once again) our position regarding the law on abortion. Enough lies!","131":"The more the desperate attempt to demonize us continues, the more many free people will side with us. Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f","132":"Now in Genoa!","133":"\u201cBrothers of Italy has no strong personality for a future government\u201d the left repeats daily.

We are in the midst of an #energy crisis, with #bills now unsustainable for #families and #businesses. Our entire productive fabric is in danger, with thousands of companies and #jobs at risk. We need to intervene immediately. Here are our proposals","145":"Incredible: in the official PD program they talk about me. How can you present your proposals to Italians and talk about your opponents? It makes you laugh, but it also makes you think a little...","146":"Kenta you're right","147":"When I meet a cat, the cat lady instinct always takes over","148":"They are afraid of our victory and are trying everything to stop us. But our shoulders are broad, because you are there to support us. On September 25th let's demonstrate together that there is no power stronger than that of the Italian people.","149":"Thanks Perugia!","150":"What a welcome here in Perugia!","151":"A just state cannot put those who can work and those who are unable to do so on the same level of welfare. A just state cannot tell our children to stay at home because there is no need for them. We desperately need the young people of our nation, we need to believe in them and make them believe in themselves. We will leave no one behind.","152":"We will continue to fight with all our strength so that Chico Forti can soon return to Italy. We owe it to him, to his daughter and to all his loved ones.","153":"Despite the rain, even in Pescara there were many people in the square listening to the programs of the Brothers of Italy to lift up the nation. Thank you!","154":"Our tour continues to talk about the Fratelli d'Italia programs. See you in Termoli and Pescara.","155":"Thank you #Cosenza!","156":"Cosenza now! Follow the live broadcast on my Facebook page","157":"On the surface they seemed like pseudo-revolutionary daddy's boys intent on tearing up an electoral poster of the Brothers of Italy for fun. In reality, simply by playing the video backwards, they are some good guys who are hanging up a slightly bent poster of mine. Thanks guys, an example of education and respect towards others. On September 25th we will win for you too \ud83d\ude18","158":"Ready to defend the environment and the beauty of our land. While the left talks about ideological manifestos, we will address environmental protection in a serious, coherent, free and innovative way, without prejudice towards economic development and new technologies. Starting with the defense of the natural asset par excellence: water.","159":"Special welcomes","160":"Thank you #Catania!","161":"Catania now! You can follow the live broadcast on my Facebook page.","162":"Ready to protect the home of Italians. The house is the primary asset around which people build their future. Fratelli d'Italia will approve a law that will say one simple thing: the first house cannot be seized, except obviously for non-payment of any mortgage loan weighing on it and in the event of prolonged arrears towards the condominium. And we will also approve another law which provides for the immediate eviction of illegal occupations of other people's homes","163":"When Luigi Di Maio and Enrico Letta throw mud at their opponents in foreign newspapers, they are not doing an injustice to the Brothers of Italy and the center-right, but to the whole of Italy. On September 25th, let's show them that this nation can still rise again, that it can still amaze the world again. Let's not give it away to people who, in order to govern, are willing to do so on the rubble.","164":"Ready to protect our pets. \"The civilization of a people is measured by the way in which they treat animals\" said Ghandi. Among the initiatives already launched in this legislature is the tightening of penalties for those who mistreat, poison and abandon them. We also want to launch campaigns on respect of animals in schools, stop the illegal trafficking of 300,000 puppies from Eastern Europe and expand pet therapy activities in nursing homes and hospitals.","165":"There are those who talk and there are those who do. There are those who depend on someone to whom they owe something, and those who depend only on the citizens with whom they have committed themselves. Fratelli d'Italia is made up of free people. We have no masters: this is why the left is afraid of us. We are ready to revive Italy. #VoteFdI","166":"Ready to restore strength to the popular will. The direct election of the President of the Republic would represent the most powerful economic measure Italy needs. The current system has led us to have 11 governments in 20 years, making the nation unstable and not very credible: the one that has grown the least of all in Europe. Italians have the right to elect the Head of State and directly choose who to govern themselves by. Enough with top-down governments and enough with P's games","167":"Ceglie Messapica: panzerotti lesson","168":"Ready to protect self-employed workers. Fratelli d'Italia has always fought for the introduction of universal shock absorbers, the same for everyone. We want to establish a tool that also guarantees self-employed people, in the event of closure of their VAT number, an unemployment benefit. A tool based on the same Naspi rules as for employees. Always on the side of those who work, in whatever form they do it.","169":"Ready to give concrete support to families. Fratelli d'Italia proposes a paradigm shift in the tax system that takes into account the composition and characteristics of families: the so-called \"family quotient\". It is one of our legislative objectives, but we will do something with a great impact immediately: we will increase the single universal allowance by 50%, which will thus reach a maximum of 260 euros per month per child. Because children are our future and the family is the nucleus","170":"Ready to restore security to our cities. Streets, squares and entire neighborhoods are completely abandoned to decay and removed from the control of the state by criminal organizations and the mafia. We need to intervene immediately: we will relaunch and strengthen the \"Safe Roads\" operation and redevelop the suburbs, because every light turned on and shutter raised are safeguards of legality. Italians also pay taxes for their security and it is the state's duty to guarantee it.","171":"Thank you #Ancona!","172":"The left's delusional mystifications against me continue. Listen to what they came up with this time\u2026","173":"Ready to support businesses that create jobs. In Italy taxes on labor are too high. We need to reduce the tax wedge and increase workers' paychecks. As? By making the State pay - under certain conditions - part of the social security contributions paid by the company and the worker. And we need to do more: reward companies that hire, according to the principle of \"the more you hire, the less taxes you pay\", starting from a mechanism of super deduction of the cost of labor for those who increase the number of employees compared to previous years.","174":"Ready to enhance sport and healthy lifestyles. How many young people fall victim to deviances such as drugs, alcohol, spirals of violence, when they are left alone? The strongest antidote is sport. Investing in the \"right to sport\" means investing in the future, cultivating talent, fighting drugs, raising new generations of Italians full of those values \u200b\u200bthat only sport can offer and transmit.","175":"Agriculture is the example par excellence of the real economy. We possess a heritage of typicality, quality, food safety and care of the territory which must be valorised. We must protect our products and Made in Italy, preventing the introduction of absurd classification systems such as the Nutri-score, designed only to target our agri-food excellence, and forcefully combating the unfair competition of Italian sounding, fake Italian products . Our land is our true wealth.","176":"Ready to defend those who do business by respecting the rules. Small and medium-sized Italian businesses represent the backbone of our nation and the custodians of #madeinitaly. But the left has treated entrepreneurs, traders and the self-employed as tax evaders regardless, to be fought and harassed with #taxes and bureaucracy. We want to give them back their dignity and the #freedom to do business, to create work and wealth. Let's start by saying enough to illegal practices and unfair competition from \"open and close\" businesses, often foreign. Anyone who wants to come to work in Italy is welcome, but anyone arriving from outside the European Union, before opening the shutter, will have to present a surety to guarantee the payment of taxes. So that everyone can compete on equal terms.","177":"Will they ever be able to discuss the issues without having to take refuge in daily attempts to demonize their opponent? Well done Guido","178":"Ready to fight poverty by investing in work. The #citizenshipincome, which cost the State 9 billion, has completely failed as a tool to fight poverty and as an active #work policy measure. For this reason we want to replace it with a tool to protect truly fragile subjects: disabled people, those over 60 and families with dependent minors without income. A citizen who can work must be helped to find a job, because the only way to truly defeat poverty is through work, not state welfare.","179":"","180":"For days in the international press we have been reading articles in which #fratelliditalia is described as a danger to democracy, to Italian, European and international stability. Obviously nothing true. To this narrative, inspired and fueled by the left, I decided to respond with a video that I recorded in #French, #English and #Spanish (I don't venture into German \ud83d\ude02) to better explain who we are and what we want to do. So anyone who really wants to delve deeper, and not be fed by our adversaries, will be able to do so. Those on the left who continue with this narrative will not damage me or FdI but the whole of Italy. And he will take responsibility for it. Ps. The video has already been sent abroad in the full version in a single language depending on the country. We made a collage for you... \u263a\ufe0f","181":"Artificial intelligence and sanctioning system to register our #young people who enter the #job market? Nothing real. Listen to yet another #hoax from the left.","182":"I don't accept the story that those who are not left-wing are worthless, that #centre-right voters are illiterate. You don't need a party card to deserve something and I want to restore pride to all those people who, for years, had to hide in order to get where they wanted. #Brothers of Italy","183":"5 years have passed since the Trieste congress.

It's a shame, however, that, once again, they were unable to understand a simple text. I'll try to explain it to him again.","187":"The data from these elections force us to bring Letta back to planet earth. If the Democratic Party is so sure of having won these administrative elections, then it must have the courage to immediately face the political #elections. The Center-Right must return united and compact to win the great challenges that await us.","188":"We're back in #school, but this time it will be the last. With the #maturity exam, not only an educational journey ends, but also a life journey, made up of emotions, fears and feelings. This #exam will mark your transition to adulthood and to you - girls and boys who will face this important moment - I wish you the most sincere good luck. Strength, determination and courage: tomorrow is yours, live it intensely.","189":"My response to La7's insults","190":"After the great result of FDI in the administrative elections, punctual like clockwork, the ideological paraphernalia of the left against us begins. They will continue undaunted in their desperate attempt to stop us, but as long as the Italians are with us they will not have won. Because there is no power stronger than the Italian people. PS: the Democratic Party's foreign affairs director accuses us of being \"financially supported by Russia\". I DEMAND to know from Enrico Letta whether he agrees with these statements.","191":"The entirely Italian paradox is that a twenty-year-old boy, who could work, can get up to \u20ac780 of #citizenshipincome and a disabled person, however, a pension of \u20ac270. Does this seem normal to you? Young people must be able to work to participate in the growth of their community: wealth is not built with a decree, wealth is created by workers and companies","192":"Thank you little ones \u2764\ufe0f #viterbo","193":"With the great Maestro Andrea #Bocelli, Italian pride \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9","194":"Long live Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 #2nd June #festadellarepubblica #bersaglieri","195":"Warm welcome in #Messina #Sicily","196":"According to the \"democrat\" Laura Boldrini, #fratelliditalia would not have the right to govern even if it won the elections.

Will the images of these hours be able to make the left understand the difference between \"economic migrants\" and real refugees?","215":"Caring about who we are, knowing what we stand for, is all we need to face this challenge. We will awaken many others like us... and there will always be more of us. #fratelliditalia #cpac","216":"We will not be part of their small circles because we prefer the squares and we will not be part of their #mainstream because we are on the side of the #people. We will not give up and we will fight them head on. #cpac","217":"In #foreign policy we must always evaluate in relation to #national interest. This is what Fratelli d'Italia does: we are not the puppets of foreign leaders. The only thread we have is the one that binds us to the #Italian people.","218":"Unlike many others, we have never defended privileges. We are defending #work and entrepreneurs who had trusted the State and now have to fight tooth and nail to save their business. #fratelliditalia #cameradeideputati","219":"The result of the #greenpass was only to manage to pit Italians against each other. And while Italy was busy taking the debate to extremes and creating discrimination, the other nations of the world started again.","220":"We want to defend Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9","221":"Let it be clear to everyone: we will never form a government with the PD and with the left. Our values \u200b\u200bare and will remain those of the right and center-right.","222":"Citizens and businesses crushed by the crisis and increases, but the priority of politics and the media is to demonize the only opposition to the government. Listen carefully to what is happening: don't be fooled.","223":"I don't subscribe to the \"either you adapt to the system or you don't count for anything\" policy. I fight this system. I don't bend. #Brothers of Italy"},"duration":{"0":"5:17","1":"2:43","2":"1:27","3":"1:12","4":"9:10","5":"5:16","6":"3:70","7":"6:26","8":"2:56","9":"0:49","10":"1:23","11":"4:52","12":"1:45","13":"2:37","14":"0:32","15":"0:58","16":"2:19","17":"1:80","18":"1:30","19":"2:44","20":"2:30","21":"0:11","22":"2:10","23":"0:54","24":"0:48","25":"1:42","26":"1:17","27":"6:58","28":"1:11","29":"0:39","30":"0:22","31":"6:19","32":"1:47","33":"1:52","34":"1:80","35":"0:47","36":"1:44","37":"0:51","38":"1:33","39":"3:34","40":"0:57","41":"4:11","42":"1:13","43":"5:16","44":"1:26","45":"1:35","46":"1:60","47":"1:11","48":"3:17","49":"1:29","50":"1:70","51":"0:49","52":"0:51","53":"0:45","54":"4:14","55":"3:25","56":"3:28","57":"1:52","58":"2:50","59":"4:33","60":"2:21","61":"0:47","62":"0:20","63":"0:47","64":"4:59","65":"1:57","66":"9:50","67":"0:50","68":"1:30","69":"4:00","70":"6:54","71":"4:12","72":"0:37","73":"0:29","74":"0:39","75":"2:38","76":"1:42","77":"3:39","78":"2:34","79":"0:59","80":"1:52","81":"1:16","82":"7:47","83":"9:51","84":"1:14","85":"1:37","86":"0:23","87":"2:70","88":"0:21","89":"1:20","90":"2:20","91":"1:33","92":"3:12","93":"3:43","94":"0:50","95":"9:48","96":"0:29","97":"0:20","98":"3:10","99":"3:38","100":"4:60","101":"1:41","102":"1:90","103":"1:54","104":"3:60","105":"0:45","106":"0:25","107":"1:18","108":"0:21","109":"1:16","110":"0:50","111":"0:11","112":"1:12","113":"1:90","114":"0:22","115":"2:60","116":"0:28","117":"0:51","118":"0:40","119":"0:35","120":"2:60","121":"1:14","122":"1:57","123":"4:45","124":"3:10","125":"0:11","126":"0:24","127":"3:19","128":"0:53","129":"1:90","130":"1:19","131":"0:28","132":"0:16","133":"0:13","134":"0:46","135":"0:30","136":"0:20","137":"0:17","138":"2:70","139":"2:27","140":"0:24","141":"0:25","142":"0:20","143":"0:38","144":"3:44","145":"0:44","146":"0:24","147":"0:20","148":"0:32","149":"0:13","150":"0:23","151":"2:53","152":"1:44","153":"0:16","154":"0:90","155":"0:11","156":"0:12","157":"0:30","158":"1:38","159":"0:50","160":"0:90","161":"0:15","162":"1:41","163":"2:70","164":"1:28","165":"0:38","166":"1:24","167":"0:37","168":"1:39","169":"1:49","170":"1:50","171":"0:70","172":"3:33","173":"1:50","174":"1:53","175":"1:40","176":"1:40","177":"2:90","178":"2:10","179":"0:23","180":"6:20","181":"3:70","182":"1:16","183":"1:26","184":"0:60","185":"0:40","186":"2:40","187":"1:56","188":"0:15","189":"5:22","190":"2:31","191":"1:41","192":"0:12","193":"0:15","194":"0:17","195":"0:24","196":"3:54","197":"2:80","198":"1:55","199":"0:20","200":"0:16","201":"0:48","202":"1:21","203":"1:19","204":"0:32","205":"1:15","206":"1:18","207":"1:24","208":"0:30","209":"2:30","210":"2:55","211":"3:45","212":"2:28","213":"0:57","214":"1:57","215":"1:43","216":"1:31","217":"0:26","218":"0:38","219":"1:17","220":"0:60","221":"3:00","222":"2:19","223":"1:15"}}
