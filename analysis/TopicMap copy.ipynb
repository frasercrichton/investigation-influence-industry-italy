       " 'We have also decided to help minimum pensions.',\n",
       " 'Now we will revalue pensions, we will revalue all pensions according to indexation, but we will do it with a different percentage based on how high the pension is.',\n",
       " 'That is, we have decided that minimum pensions are revalued not by one hundred percent, but by one hundred percent.',\n",
