      "Taxation on banks' unfair margins. A common sense measure that allows us to help Italian families and businesses in difficulty. #gliappuntidigiorgia\n",
      "The new rules on citizenship income are starting to come into force in recent days. It is good to clarify this topic, especially after the controversy and the many falsehoods that have been told. The Government does not intend to retrace its steps: our great objective is to move from citizenship income to employment income, the one obtained thanks to work. #gliappuntidigiorgia\n",
      "There is nothing I want to say to those who criticize me, I think it is their right. The only way I like to answer is with results. So I act, I do what I think is right for my Nation, for the interests of my Nation.\n",
      "Whatever the international forum, Italy will always present itself with its head held high. National interest is the only beacon that guides our action.\n",
      "The excellent results of the mission in the U.S.A. brings great satisfaction and a renewed interest in Italy in the world.

      "We are waiting for you in Italy, Zaki\n",
      "Very satisfied with the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Tunisia and the EU and with Italy's fundamental role in its success. The agreement is based on five pillars: macro-financial assistance, strengthening economic relations, energy cooperation, combating illegal immigration and promoting people-to-people contacts. It is only the beginning of a path that can allow a collaboration different from that of the past, based on strong international relations that allow us to achieve common results.\n",
      "Among the various measures we are implementing to give concrete and incisive support to the families most affected by the crisis, and in general by high prices, today we present the \"Dedicated to you\" card for the purchase of basic necessities.

      "Good luck to all graduates!\n",
      "Thanks Silvio. We won't forget you.\n",
      "The attacks never unsettled him. To those who, even today, are pouring hatred towards him, he would have responded as usual with a smile and a joke. We will remember him like this.\n",
      "To God, Silvio.\n",
      "Does the left accuse the government of authoritarian drift? The truth is that I'm a little short on arguments and in just over 6 months we have dismantled their entire catastrophist narrative.\n",
      "Long live a democratic, free, sovereign Italy. Long live the Italy that wants to grow, innovate, amaze. Long live Italy that wants to return to being a protagonist in the world. Thanks to all the men and women who make this nation great every dayüáÆüáπ #FestadellaRepubblica\n",

The task of the Government and the State, in addition to the incredible work of the Civil Protection, the Police Forces, the Armed Forces, the Fire Brigade and the Coast Guard, is to guarantee immediate responses. The first resources will be for the emergency and for all the measures necessary to exempt companies and citizens from paying taxes. We will then need to work on compensation and reconstruction: for this reason, a complete estimate and simplification of procedures will first be necessary. We are ready to do our part.\n",
      "The #G7 Summit in #Hiroshima, Japan was very intense. With the other Heads of State and Government I spent two days marked by many discussion sessions and bilateral meetings, which allowed us to address many crucial issues of our time. A very significant moment was the laying of a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, where I paid my honors and due respect to the victims of the atomic bomb in World War II. I thank Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for the determination and seriousness with which he organized this important Summit and for managing a presidency in a difficult context. Next year it will be Italy's turn to host the G7, and we will do so in Puglia, a region symbolizing the meeting between West and East. It is a great responsibility for Italy, but we will be up to the task. We continue to work together, in the unity of all members, demonstrating that the G7 is strong and determined, ready to face present and future challenges, for international peace and security and for our Nations.\n",

      "Our history is not one of melancholy, but of great feats, creativity and results that have impressed the world. That is the Italy we want to live in again. We want to give back to Italians the certainty and pride of living in a nation capable of looking to the future, where people want to do and realize themselves. A nation in which we rediscover the beauty of becoming #parents\n",

We defend the Italian brand and our companies.\n",

      "We do not intend to bow to the many powerful pressures of those who would like to impose the ideological vision of a world without national borders. Italy and Europe can no longer remain under the blackmail of unscrupulous smugglers, who use migrants as human shields for their trafficking, nor allow these criminals to decide who can arrive on our shores and who cannot. We will move forward on this because it is the only way to stop deaths at sea, protect the weakest and guarantee safety\n",

We are weathering a terrible storm that is making it difficult for our ships to navigate. But now we can make a difference.\n",

      "On 1 March 1961 the National Acrobatic Team was born in Rivolto. Since then, the Frecce Tricolori of the Italian Air Force have been flying over our skies with extraordinary aerobatics. Symbol of our national unity and identity, they represent an all-Italian pride. Best wishes üáÆüáπ\n",

      "Palazzo Chigi, today. In memory of the Martyrs of the Foibe and the exiles of Istria, Fiume and Dalmatia.\n",
      "I am very happy with the results obtained by Italy in this European Council. There were those who thought that Italian foreign policy consisted only of getting pats on the back, whereas today we have demonstrated that the interests of the nation have international relevance.

      "On Covid, the restrictive model adopted in the past did not work, as we are also seeing in China. My idea is that we need to work on empowering citizens and on prevention, rather than on the deprivation of freedoms. And I intend to continue like this in the future too.\n",
      "In Erbil, to bring the nation's thanks to the Italian soldiers who carry out their work every day with a great spirit of self-sacrifice and sacrifice. Furthermore, I am truly grateful for the gifts with which they honored me: the Tricolor with the signatures of all the soldiers present and the magnificent mosaic of my image in which each card is made up of photographs of the Italian soldiers of the contingent in Iraq. An immense honor.\n",

      "Saturday, 5.30 pm, #gliappuntidigiorgia in Piazza del Popolo. Appointment in Rome for the event dedicated to 10 years of Fratelli d'Italia.\n",

Now who can explain to him that on my page there is, in addition to several photos, the live broadcast of my speech where the square packed with people was filmed for an hour?

A just state cannot tell our children to stay at home because there is no need for them. We desperately need the young people of our nation, we need to believe in them and make them believe in themselves. We will leave no one behind.\n",
      "We will continue to fight with all our strength so that Chico Forti can soon return to Italy. We owe it to him, to his daughter and to all his loved ones.\n",
      "Despite the rain, even in Pescara there were many people in the square listening to the programs of the Brothers of Italy to lift up the nation. Thank you!\n",
      "Our tour continues to talk about the Fratelli d'Italia programs. See you in Termoli and Pescara.\n",

      "On the surface they seemed like pseudo-revolutionary daddy's boys intent on tearing up an electoral poster of the Brothers of Italy for fun. In reality, simply by playing the video backwards, they are some good guys who are hanging up a slightly bent poster of mine. Thanks guys, an example of education and respect towards others. On September 25th we will win for you too üòò\n",
      "Ready to defend the environment and the beauty of our land. While the left talks about ideological manifestos, we will address environmental protection in a serious, coherent, free and innovative way, without prejudice towards economic development and new technologies. Starting with the defense of the natural asset par excellence: water.\n",
      "Special welcomes\n",
      "Thank you #Catania!\n",
      "Catania now! You can follow the live broadcast on my Facebook page.\n",
      "Ready to protect the home of Italians. The house is the primary asset around which people build their future. Fratelli d'Italia will approve a law that will say one simple thing: the first house cannot be seized, except obviously for non-payment of any mortgage loan weighing on it and in the event of prolonged arrears towards the condominium. And we will also approve another law which provides for the immediate eviction of illegal occupations of other people's homes\n",
      "When Luigi Di Maio and Enrico Letta throw mud at their opponents in foreign newspapers, they are not doing an injustice to the Brothers of Italy and the center-right, but to the whole of Italy. On September 25th, let's show them that this nation can still rise again, that it can still amaze the world again. Let's not give it away to people who, in order to govern, are willing to do so on the rubble.\n",
      "Ready to protect our pets. \"The civilization of a people is measured by the way in which they treat animals\" said Ghandi. Among the initiatives already launched in this legislature is the tightening of penalties for those who mistreat, poison and abandon them. We also want to launch campaigns on respect of animals in schools, stop the illegal trafficking of 300,000 puppies from Eastern Europe and expand pet therapy activities in nursing homes and hospitals.\n",
      "There are those who talk and there are those who do. There are those who depend on someone to whom they owe something, and those who depend only on the citizens with whom they have committed themselves. Fratelli d'Italia is made up of free people. We have no masters: this is why the left is afraid of us. We are ready to revive Italy. #VoteFdI\n",
      "Ready to restore strength to the popular will. The direct election of the President of the Republic would represent the most powerful economic measure Italy needs. The current system has led us to have 11 governments in 20 years, making the nation unstable and not very credible: the one that has grown the least of all in Europe. Italians have the right to elect the Head of State and directly choose who to govern themselves by. Enough with top-down governments and enough with P's games\n",
      "Ceglie Messapica: panzerotti lesson\n",
      "Ready to protect self-employed workers. Fratelli d'Italia has always fought for the introduction of universal shock absorbers, the same for everyone. We want to establish a tool that also guarantees self-employed people, in the event of closure of their VAT number, an unemployment benefit. A tool based on the same Naspi rules as for employees. Always on the side of those who work, in whatever form they do it.\n",
      "Ready to give concrete support to families. Fratelli d'Italia proposes a paradigm shift in the tax system that takes into account the composition and characteristics of families: the so-called \"family quotient\". It is one of our legislative objectives, but we will do something with a great impact immediately: we will increase the single universal allowance by 50%, which will thus reach a maximum of 260 euros per month per child. Because children are our future and the family is the nucleus\n",
      "Ready to restore security to our cities. Streets, squares and entire neighborhoods are completely abandoned to decay and removed from the control of the state by criminal organizations and the mafia. We need to intervene immediately: we will relaunch and strengthen the \"Safe Roads\" operation and redevelop the suburbs, because every light turned on and shutter raised are safeguards of legality. Italians also pay taxes for their security and it is the state's duty to guarantee it.\n",
      "Thank you #Ancona!\n",
      "The left's delusional mystifications against me continue. Listen to what they came up with this time‚Ä¶\n",
      "Ready to support businesses that create jobs. In Italy taxes on labor are too high. We need to reduce the tax wedge and increase workers' paychecks. As? By making the State pay - under certain conditions - part of the social security contributions paid by the company and the worker. And we need to do more: reward companies that hire, according to the principle of \"the more you hire, the less taxes you pay\", starting from a mechanism of super deduction of the cost of labor for those who increase the number of employees compared to previous years.\n",
      "Ready to enhance sport and healthy lifestyles. How many young people fall victim to deviances such as drugs, alcohol, spirals of violence, when they are left alone? The strongest antidote is sport. Investing in the \"right to sport\" means investing in the future, cultivating talent, fighting drugs, raising new generations of Italians full of those values ‚Äã‚Äãthat only sport can offer and transmit.\n",
      "Agriculture is the example par excellence of the real economy. We possess a heritage of typicality, quality, food safety and care of the territory which must be valorised. We must protect our products and Made in Italy, preventing the introduction of absurd classification systems such as the Nutri-score, designed only to target our agri-food excellence, and forcefully combating the unfair competition of Italian sounding, fake Italian products . Our land is our true wealth.\n",
      "Ready to defend those who do business by respecting the rules. Small and medium-sized Italian businesses represent the backbone of our nation and the custodians of #madeinitaly. But the left has treated entrepreneurs, traders and the self-employed as tax evaders regardless, to be fought and harassed with #taxes and bureaucracy. We want to give them back their dignity and the #freedom to do business, to create work and wealth. Let's start by saying enough to illegal practices and unfair competition from \"open and close\" businesses, often foreign. Anyone who wants to come to work in Italy is welcome, but anyone arriving from outside the European Union, before opening the shutter, will have to present a surety to guarantee the payment of taxes. So that everyone can compete on equal terms.\n",
      "Will they ever be able to discuss the issues without having to take refuge in daily attempts to demonize their opponent? Well done Guido\n",
      "Ready to fight poverty by investing in work. The #citizenshipincome, which cost the State 9 billion, has completely failed as a tool to fight poverty and as an active #work policy measure. For this reason we want to replace it with a tool to protect truly fragile subjects: disabled people, those over 60 and families with dependent minors who have no income. A citizen who can work must be helped to find a job, because the only way to truly defeat poverty is through work, not state welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "For days in the international press we have been reading articles in which #fratelliditalia is described as a danger to democracy, to Italian, European and international stability. Obviously nothing true. To this narrative, inspired and fueled by the left, I decided to respond with a video that I recorded in #French, #English and #Spanish (I don't venture into German üòÇ) to better explain who we are and what we want to do. So anyone who really wants to delve deeper, and not be fed by our adversaries, will be able to do so. Those on the left who continue with this narrative will not damage me or FdI but the whole of Italy. And he will take responsibility for it. Ps. The video has already been sent abroad in the full version in a single language depending on the country. We made a collage for you... ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n",

You don't need a party card to deserve something and I want to restore pride to all those people who, for years, had to hide in order to get where they wanted. #Brothers of Italy\n",

      "Scoop from the left: \"8 years ago Meloni said she agreed with the #iusscholae while now she is voting against it\". It's a shame, however, that, once again, they were unable to understand a simple text. I'll try to explain it to him again.\n",
      "The data from these elections force us to bring Letta back to planet earth. If the Democratic Party is so sure of having won these administrative elections, then it must have the courage to immediately face the political #elections. The Center-Right must return united and compact to win the great challenges that await us.\n",
      "We're back in #school, but this time it will be the last. With the #maturity exam, not only an educational journey ends, but also a life journey, made up of emotions, fears and feelings. This #exam will mark your transition to adulthood and to you - girls and boys who will face this important moment - I wish you the most sincere good luck. Strength, determination and courage: tomorrow is yours, live it intensely.\n",
      "My response to La7's insults\n",
      "After the great result of FDI in the administrative elections, punctual like clockwork, the ideological paraphernalia of the left against us begins. They will continue undaunted in their desperate attempt to stop us, but as long as the Italians are with us they will not have won. Because there is no power stronger than the Italian people. PS: the Democratic Party's foreign affairs director accuses us of being \"financially supported by Russia\". I DEMAND to know from Enrico Letta whether he agrees with these statements.\n",
      "The entirely Italian paradox is that a twenty-year-old boy, who could work, can get up to ‚Ç¨780 of #citizenshipincome and a disabled person, however, a pension of ‚Ç¨270. Does this seem normal to you? Young people must be able to work to participate in the growth of their community: wealth is not built with a decree, wealth is created by workers and companies\n",
