          "I intervened, I responded to interviews, I wrote a letter to the European Council and the European Commission.",
          "And already in the first months of the legislature, despite the inevitably limited resources we have available, we have given signals in this sense, interventions to protect the purchasing power of families and workers, the renewal of the two-point cut percentages of the tax and contribution wedge which it is worth remembering the previous government had foreseen until the end of last year and the addition of a further point of the contribution cut for the lowest incomes.",
          "And besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "From the beginning it is the reason why in this, in these less than a year, we have concentrated the few resources we had at our disposal on cutting the contribution wedge, that is, putting more money in people's paychecks.",
          "That is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",
          "Another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "Including legal minimum wage, which has not been approved in the past.",
          "In my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, I'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "Because if the legal minimum wage is the solution, why didn't the parties that are now clamoring for it introduce it in the long years in which they were in government?",
          "Really who concentrated on increasing wages?",
          "For this reason I have chosen to meet the opposition starting from the specific proposal of the minimum wage because the issue of combating poor work interests us, as long as we understand the fact that the subject is an extremely broad subject and that it must be addressed in its entirety complexity.",
          "Because obviously it's the risk that we end up with a minimum wage rule.",
          "For this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "And imagine if he is not sensitive to the issue of increasing wages.",
          "But we are obviously open to discussion on the subject, which is much broader than poor work and adequate wages.",
          "And I apologize to you for the simple minimum wage measure which, as you know, according to many also according to many trade unions, according to many experts in the sector, in a nation like ours, with very high collective bargaining, risks worsening, paradoxically, the condition more workers than those for whom it could improve it.",
          "There are disagreements on what the tools are to strengthen the purchasing power of families, to strengthen wages.",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "Now, in my opinion, let's say he will question me on the hypothesis that the legal minimum wage could become not a substitute parameter and let's say a parameter.",
          "The bulk of his measures are those who defend poor work as I hear some political exponents say and who instead has led to the inadequate wages we have today are friends of the workers because now that he is in opposition he is proposing the minimum wage?",
          "But then why didn't we accept the opposition's proposal on the legal minimum wage as it was presented?",
          "Obviously on an economic level it is one of our great priorities and it clearly interests us when the question of strengthening wages is raised.",
          "Look, what I want to do is simply give a signal of attention and respect on an issue that is close to my heart, because unlike those who today propose a minimum wage from the opposition, but when they were in government they did not implement the minimum wage.",
          "We have ninety-seven percent of workers covered by a contract that has been signed by at least one of the three main unions.",
          "And if instead in those three years he had had the opportunity to work and improve himself, he would have been richer and poorer..",
          "I believe that it is much more effective to extend collective bargaining even in sectors where it is not currently foreseen.",
          "Paradoxically, to look after their interests, the large economic concentrations, which are the only ones that would gain from a generalized reduction in wages, are, let's say, within reach.",
          "I am thinking of the issue of strengthening the lowest wages, particularly with the cut in the contribution wedge.",
          "And then measures to increase the incentives that lead researchers who have fled abroad to return to Italy.",
          "This means that obviously those who have cash to spend, perhaps foreigners, prefer to go and do it in other countries, because it cannot be done in Italy.. Then on the topic of tax evasion this too is unfortunately tragically contradicted by the numbers.",
          "In Italy we are considered a virtuous country because we have a very high percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining, i.e.",
          "Well, now the Italians are also expecting an intervention on wages and this is one of our priorities, we have already started with the money it cost to cut excise duties for four months.",
          "That is, the paradox in Italy today is that a twenty-year-old boy in excellent health who could work can earn up to seven hundred and eighty euros.",
          "We want to intervene by reviewing and reorganizing the entire system of existing building subsidies, standardizing the amount of the bonuses which in any case, in our opinion, must not exceed eighty percent of the cost incurred, directing the subsidies mainly towards first homes, simplifying how always necessary and reducing the required obligations, without compromising the necessary severity of controls, always on the side of honest businesses and citizens who work hard to make Italy grow and improve.",
          "We have contributed to defending Italian energy security from the tightening of citizenship income to the cut in taxes on employment, through incentives for new hires.",
          "We told our elders that we consider them important and that we will take care of them from the release of the European agreement on the taxation of multinationals, in which Italy had a fundamental role in the regulation to put a ceiling on the salaries of the managers of the banks saved by the State until the changes to the super bonus so that its abuse could be prevented.",
          "I believe that creating the conditions, um, to improve the quality of work in Italy is a matter that concerns above all, like many other matters, the issue of economic growth, that is, above all we must put people in a position to hire.",
          "Indeed, Italy is even the only country in the European Union that has decreasing wages and if we narrow the field to the last ten years, those in which the left has governed almost continuously, we will see that wages in this period have fallen on average of one point four percent.",
          "So let's start from this assumption in the Italian legal system there have always been measures that allowed renovation and energy efficiency works to be deducted from taxes.",
          "And brothers of Italy, I think that a tax system should be added to this that rewards companies that create jobs in Italy over those that don't..",
          "The example of Germany is given, the example of France is given, but they are nations that have grown by more than twenty percent in the last twenty years, Italy has grown by two percent, as we thought that our wages could grow adequately if the economy wasn't growing, the two things are inevitably linked.",
          "Obviously intervening to tackle the phenomenon of poor labor is inevitably one of the priorities on which this government works, because, as the questioners the Honorable, Schlein and others point out, Italy is the only OECD country in which from ninety to two thousand and twenty the average annual salary has decreased, while in the rest of the West it was growing.",
          "It is not fair that families and businesses always pay the price for the mistakes made in Europe and made over the years by governments.",
          "I'm not the one saying it and so there's something that doesn't add up when the prime minister comes to the chamber again yesterday and responding to a question time from the brothers of Italy says Taxes won't increase because you wrote it, you're doing it to increase taxes.",
          "And the questioners of the Democratic Party also point out, I must say with a sincerity that does them credit, that in Italy in recent years the share of gross domestic product that has been allocated to wages and salaries has decreased more than in the rest of the other industrialized states.",
          "But anyone arriving from outside the European Union before opening the shutter will have to present a surety to guarantee the payment of taxes, so that everyone can compete on equal terms.. We will restore dignity and freedom to the honest people who create work and wealth in Italy.",
          "Made above all by non-EU citizens, that of companies that do not pay a euro in taxes if they act illegally and then close their doors before the State notices them to reopen, perhaps with another name.",
          "Which means that it doesn't depend on the, the, how much they pay you per hour of work you can be above nine euros and still be considered a poor worker then a slightly more complex matter than how it is addressed in some cases, but it is a matter that must be addressed because it is a problem that Italy has without prejudice.",
          "So the government can only move forward if we increase house taxation and Italy can afford an increase in house taxation while bills are already increasing.",
          "So yes, in Italy there is a serious problem of low wage levels.",
          "And we hope that we can arrive at a serious, shared response to this, but one that improves the condition of Italian workers overall and does not improve the condition of some, while worsening that of others.",
          "the main problem that has impacted Italian families this year has been inflation and it is an issue to which the government has dedicated various measures since the beginning of its mandate.",
          "But no one says that, for example in this financial measure for the first time there is a good measure against open-and-close companies, that is, against that plague which in Italy is worth billions of euros, of Eva, of tax evasion every year, of companies that open and close before the State begins to carry out checks, that is, on average after two years they do not pay a single euro to the Italian State, disappear and start again.",
          "It is a measure that obviously impacts state coffers today, because where there is a creditor there is also a debtor and that debtor is the Italian taxpayers.",
          "But there is a problem that when the state does something it is never free, because the money it spends is taxpayers' money and therefore when it spends money it puts it on one side and takes it away from the other.. Do you know how much it cost for every single Italian, around two thousand euros, just under two thousand euros?",
          "If we looked at the OECD data on the trend of average wages, we would realize that for over thirty years the salaries of Italians in real terms have been practically frozen.",
          "Think about the effect that something like this has on hundreds and thousands of companies in Italy, forcing employees to lose their jobs, to go on layoffs which means earning less on salaries that have already been lowered by inflation.",
          "It's true, it's true, there is a problem: those who have governed until now have unfortunately made Italian workers poorer.",
          "This is also a very delicate, very important matter, on which I have found ears that are, let's say, willing, obviously to listen.",
          "It is not even these that prevent those who do not think like them from speaking.",
          "No people, so how can I say angry so desperate in short so envious as to react with this hatred?",

          "If someone is missing, it's because I say it with emotion.",
          "It seems to me that even from the let's say personal human point of view, a very frank, very positive interlocution has been created.",
          "How does he offend you?",
          "Because I am a person used to saying what he thinks, even when what he says is unpopular.",
          "Um, I don't need to use these tones and I've always assumed my responsibilities, I'm tired of others not assuming theirs.",
          "If there was a bit of intellectual honesty in this room too, perhaps someone should mend their ways.",
          "I respect and appreciate them.",
          "How does my culture offend you?",
          "I met them on Women's Day and I was breathless by their courage, their strength, their dignity.",
          "On this let's say I prefer not to go into details, eh, let's say spoil too much.",
          "I expect you to give substance to this very serious accusation.",
          "And do you spend the day insulting or mystifying?",
          "But obviously this doesn't mean that the topic isn't close to our hearts.",

          "I respect them.",
          "For goodness sake, it's okay, but in short it's also okay for me to respond and try to tell my point of view.",
          "So it is a sign of attention on a subject that is close to my heart.",
          "To be honest, I want to say that this is bad behavior, so distortions can certainly be worked on.",
          "And so I, who perhaps for too long have allowed people to go out of bounds because I am a person who has always said what he thinks, but I am never wrong in speaking, I don't need to use these tones, I don't need to use these methods to campaign against my opponents who today are all just talking about me.",
          "So I have decided that in the meantime I will clearly sue all those who have allowed themselves to say a wrong word and not so much for me, because I will continue to move forward and I don't even look at these guys anymore..",
          "And maybe you should look at these kids who are in this room and have respect for what your propaganda has done to the skin of these people, these families.",
          "I respect them, I can, I look at them with interest.",
          "To me it seems like a sign of attention and respect, of respect.",
          "Maybe you should look at these guys who are in this room and have respect.",

          "It must do so in peace with neighboring nations and the European states that border the great Russian bear must be able to look to the future with serenity.",
          "Or should it rather be the expected opposite, that is, a figure, for example, like Dostoievski is exactly the cultural antidote against every form of autocracy, including the Putinian one if desired.",

          "We must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "Even at the beginning it was not possible on credits that had been sold even ten times.",
          "Families and entrepreneurs are increasingly resorting to usurious credit, because the banks, immobilized by regulations that are too stringent, are actually unable to respond to the current demand for credit.",
          "For this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",
          "Instead we want to push as much as possible banks, companies and all the actors involved to allow the acquisition of credits that are already at a standstill, those so-called stranded credits, i.e.",
          "Which means that if we left the transferability of those credits throughout this year, at the end of this year we would have at least another forty million euros.",
          "And obviously it also happened that the bubble inflated so much that at a certain point those who had these credits, mainly companies, could no longer compensate them because they had exhausted, let's say, their possibility of compensating that credit with taxes and could no longer not even to sell them, because even the fiscal drawers of the banks of the other actors who could buy those credits have closed and there are perfectly honest people who have done some work, who have trusted the State, who have done what the State said which found itself in the hands of some work done and money that it cannot take because this has produced this very interesting free measure that today we have thousands of companies that risk collapse and therefore since we inherited it, we now have to look for a solution to prevent thousands of companies from risking collapse because someone could say during the election campaign that they renovated houses for free and that's exactly what we tried to do.",
          "This change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "We have made a rule that allows us to say Don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
          "On the other hand we said that in the future it will no longer be possible to exceed those credits.",
          "In our opinion, in this difficult situation it is essential for the banking system to behave, so to speak, in the most correct manner possible.",
          "Because in all of this, since there have been many scams in this matter, obviously those who have to acquire the credit are afraid of being co-responsible for anyone who may have generated a scam.",
          "You cannot assign the credit you have generated to another actor.",
          "But it's obvious that for goodness' sake, if you take someone's credit and you haven't even gone to check whether not only the work has been done, but whether the property exists as happened, you are co-responsible because in short, a minimum of control should done, but if you couldn't have known some things.",
          "Above all because in our opinion this is one of the most effective ways to help the so-called exoduses of the one hundred and ten, that is, those companies that have remained in the hands of those people who have been left in the hands of credits and money for work done that they risk not seeing and therefore we must facilitate the purchase of those credits.",

          "something new has been added in recent weeks, namely that this government has started its own.",
          "And what will your government's strategy be at that point?",
          "It seems to me that this government, from all points of view, is not giving a great account of itself, even, I mean, on the international issue.",
          "This government must do what it can to reverse the trend.",
          "No, but could it be a government program?",
          "In the meantime, what has the government done?",
          "Are we also talking about a change of direction by the government here?",
          "For the other it was a bolt from the blue, but this is false because what we did was not only written in the center-right government program, but was included in the budget law that was passed last December.",
          "So we are already working on the budget law.",
          "There is talk these days of the possibility of an accelerated budget law in the summer for a vote in September.",
          "We eliminate the contribution.",
          "So in short, I trust that we do not have to modify, let's say the government's initiatives, even a fairly defined schedule that we also had on some provisions that depend on the Def, which for me are very significant, in particular in terms of work in the next days, with May 1st.",
          "And I have proposed a much broader discussion that also involves those who are constitutionally, let's say, more equipped to do this work, which is the CNEL, to finish before the start of the budget law, therefore also in time to obviously and possibly have the coverage necessary to take action.",
          "And when the public budget collapses?",
          "Our latest amendment was approved in recent days as part of the conversion work of the aid decree bis.",
          "I can announce to you now that the budget law that we will present follows the trend of the previous one, that is, work income, which is what we have already done with all the main provisions of the previous one, starting from the extension of the audience of those who benefited, of the bonus for gas and electricity, up to, let's say, the first signals we have given on productivity bonuses.",
          "This is a simple and responsible proposal that we intend to implement immediately, already in the next budget law.",
          "So on the one hand we must defend the public budget because otherwise the results will be dramatic for everyone.",
          "So it is good to arrive in time before the budget law to do this work.",
          "Budget law.",
          "And those public budgets are the state budget, but they are also the budgets of local authorities.",
          "Now with the reduction of the contribution wedge we are going there on the budget law.",

          "That is, you have to know when you go to get petrol, whether where you are getting petrol compared to what the average does, let's say for all the others, is convenient for you or not, because this automatically helps us to fight some of those who may be the not many.",
          "So the priority is to immediately set a price for gas at European level so that speculation can finally be blocked and this would immediately lower bills.",
          "Basic hygiene, petrol has reached two and twenty euros.",
          "After that, there is certainly an intervention that needs to be done with regards to the motorway network, where sometimes the price is um, can be significantly higher by virtue of the concessions, because sometimes in service stations the motorway manager gives a sub concession and in this passage sometimes some rules are skipped and therefore I think that on this too we need to make the concessionaires responsible for future concessions to monitor what happens.",
          "And beyond this, the price of energy must be immediately disconnected from the price of gas.",
          "The European Union suddenly found itself hostage to Russian blackmail on gas and harnessed to an energy pricing mechanism that actually encourages speculation.",
          "what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes.",
          "Obviously the international question, the crisis in Ukraine, the eh, the domino, so to speak, of consequences, which therefore obviously produces the issue of the need to give concreteness to a European solution on the issue of rising costs as soon as possible of energy on the topic of a note on a cap on the price of gas that was discussed.",
          "And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.",
          "Now here is something that needs to be explained everyone all the petrol stations in Italy are required to communicate to the institutions if they make price changes some do not make these communications.",
          "Now since I am a serious person and obviously I monitor the results of what I produce, I am monitoring the price of petrol.",
          "The decrease in the cost of energy is favoring production, encouraging companies to start hiring again and it was therefore certainly the right choice to continue the battle for the introduction of a European ceiling on the price of gas",
          "In the event that you do not comply with these requirements and we want to do, we have done something even more important and that is established that in each petrol station, in addition to the obligation to display the price at the pump of that petrol station, there is also the average daily price.",
          "I'm sorry that I had to convene them on Sunday, but unfortunately it was impossible for us, for me and for Minister Giorgetti who at the ecofin to convene them first, however, in short, everything is organized and I trust we can move forward.",

          "But today's Council of Ministers, with another decree, dealt with other very important matters, over two thousand new men in the personnel of the police, the Coast Guard, the Fire Brigade, that is, over two thousand people to strengthen the safety of citizens.",
          "In short, with the heads of delegation, with the group leaders, because everyone must be involved.",
          "And that is exactly what our decree provides, the decree that the council of ministers passed.",
          "I am very, very satisfied, I have to thank the minister pichetto, the minister dense who worked on it, the minister cingolani who had worked on it before and obviously now it is a question of monitoring for an effective application, in short of the roof within the expected timescales in such a way quick",
          "Then from these first meetings a series of obviously very concrete dossiers will arise on the various subjects.",
          "Thank you for how you will be able to do this, always considering a team as we are doing, already at the Council of Ministers level.",
          "There is a council of ministers convened as you know for Tuesday there is the whole day tomorrow to, optimize the measures.",

          "Here, with a bit of discussion also between us or among other things, already in recent days I was thinking of periodically meeting the group leaders, taking stock of the situation.",

          "We have demonstrated with facts that we care about this issue because everything we have done, the bulk of what we have done has been dedicated to this matter.",
          "So we decided to intervene.",
          "So we intervened and continue to intervene.",
          "It's a bit like a guide to outline a course of action.",
          "Well, I think it's important.",

          "We do not intend to abolish Law One Hundred and Ninety-Four.",
          "When I think something I say it, if I had wanted to abolish or modify law one hundred and ninety-four I would have declared it because I am different from many other politicians I have seen.",
          "But look, if I had presented myself with a structured counter-proposal from the government it would have been said that I didn't want to allow the opposition to do theirs, just as when I proposed to make a comparison with in I was accused of wanting to make the opposition withdraw the proposal.",
          "no regulatory changes for those who had already started the works which fell within.",
          "One hundred and ten for the future.",
          "Excuse me, do you want to change the one hundred and ninety-four or not?",
          "In reality we don't want to abolish it.",

          "It will probably be easier than what happens in Campania, where a quarter of those excluded from the measure live.",
          "Frankly, among other things, it wouldn't make sense on such an important measure.",
          "Eh, there are the measures.",
          "Homework is good measures, they are useful measures.",
          "In truth, these are measures that already exist on paper, but which need to be enormously strengthened.",
          "And I also believe that we need to work a little on scams, because we have also seen several scams on this measure.",
          "So in the meantime, obviously the measure was not free at all.",
          "What are the measures?",
          "And this is interesting because I remember when someone who invented this measure went around during the election campaign saying that thanks to him you were able to renovate your house for free.",

          "No, we always celebrate what's wrong with this nation.",
          "But I repeat, politics doesn't do this or politics does it marginally and what politics does can only do because there are people who every day decide to sacrifice a little piece of themselves for this homeland, for this nation..",

          "In short, I consider it an excellent starting point, the result of important Italian work, not only political, but also of our diplomacy and therefore I am, let's say, quite optimistic President on economic dossiers.",
          "I can speak very badly about Italy, but I do it in my home, I do it in parliament, I do it with my opponents, I do it with the Italians at home, but outside you won't hear me speaking badly about Italy, I have done something interview with fox news and I didn't do it to speak badly of Italy in case the left won, I did it to say what I want to do, I did it to explain that this nation can get back on its feet, that this nation it can still be a proud nation, it can be a nation that amazes, as it has amazed throughout its history throughout its civilization.",
          "The fires and meteorological disasters of the last few days have put and continue to put Italy to the test.",
          "The question for me is not how we pass them on one side, as we say, we dump the problem from one side of Europe to the other and the only way to solve it for everyone is to stop them and stop the primary movements, therefore the arrivals in Italy.",
          "We are aware of the fact that the path of a serious, respectful, respected, credible, courageous Italy has been paved by the sacrifice of many people, obviously before you.",
          "But obviously Italy continues to be fully committed to our contribution, the all-round contribution because we are aware of how we have said it several times?",
          "It is above all an insult towards people who are sacrificing their lives to achieve, to allow Italy to achieve these victories there are people who work twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, shadowing, listening of hours and hours and hours of phone calls who are there they don't see their family, they don't go on holiday, they don't they don't they don't they don't they don't take holidays anything to allow us to win.",
          "We are talking about how we have let's say, brought people to how we have managed the green pass, now honestly in Italy with rules that have abolished article one of the constitution.",
          "And therefore Italy must say thank you, because Italy knows that it can count on you.",
          "dear friends, it is a great honor for the Italian government to welcome you to Rome for this conference dedicated to development and migration.",
          "The paradox is Italy and so maybe it's worth it, right?",
          "Obviously it also depends on ours, our return, our ability to be credible, influential and esteemed as Italy knows how to be..",
          "And for me this is a very important element, because the Italian government's approach completely changes compared to what we have seen in recent years.",
          "It was ideological fury that made Italy what we saw in this, particularly in this last year, because the solutions were there and we had proposed them and we must each assume our own responsibilities.",
          "And because today I meet an Italy that is giving very encouraging signals, giving employment, growth, consumer confidence, investor confidence, an Italy respected on an international level and therefore I am, let's say at peace with myself, for the work I did.",
          "We no longer intend to remain under the blackmail of unscrupulous smugglers who use migrants as human shields for their trafficking and we no longer intend to let these criminals decide who can arrive in Italy and who cannot.",
          "Now this may seem trivial, but in reality it is not because, let's say, it is not always what Italy has done.",
          "And I believe that that homeland, in days like these, must be there to say, to tell you that the credibility, the pride, the reliability that Italy can boast in the world which make it respected, respectable, richer, walk on your legs, on your example and on your sacrifices.",
          "We have brought about a change of pace for the State in combating illegality from the fight against illegal immigration, with the decree on NGOs, the recognition by the European Union of the need to address the problem in a structural way, as requested by Italy up to the management of legal immigration, setting the quotas of those who can come to work in Italy respecting the rules.",
          "What is the Italian government doing?",
          "And a system that gives stability to the government, an institutional system worthy of a great Western nation like Italy to return to being protagonists in Europe and in the world to return to investing in our future, to return to growth and prosperity",
          "The results once again disprove the predictions and make us responsible to do more and more, to do better, aware as we are that a strong and credible Italy outside national borders means above all an Italy capable of affirming the interests and needs of its citizens.",
          "Except that it is a proud Italy that does not change its position from one day to the next because as long as I am in government, this Italy I want to represent a woman at the helm of the Democratic Party.",
          "In the specific case, for example, of Cutro, in the event that people die during one of these crossings and attention, an element that I consider very important, the crime will be prosecuted by Italy even if committed outside the national borders.",
          "And it is a job with which Italy once again demonstrates its ability to be, yes, a nation that knows how to offer heroism, which knows how to offer sacrifice, which knows how to offer professionalism, but which also knows how to offer humanity.",
          "for Italy in recent years we always said yesterday no on development cooperation, that is, when there is no water there are those who bring bottles of water and there are those who bring a dinner, that is, those who want to leave the autonomy the freedom of the nations in which it cooperates, so that that nation can grow and the sign of Italian cooperation has always been like this.",
          "And in any case, Italy will continue to support today and obviously intends to be a protagonist in the possible future reconstruction of the country.",
          "Instead we asked ourselves whether there should be more or less Italy in Europe.",
          "You are great ambassadors of Italian culture, but above all for what you do for your nation.",
          "And if we don't rediscover what binds us and makes us a community of destiny, believing in what we are is the most powerful petrol we can put in the engine of the nation and the fuel we need to chart new routes and return to being protagonists in Italy and in the world",
          "I'm happy with how this day, um, how this day went, in which obviously I discussed, brought the Italian point of view on some of the biggest issues we face.",
          "First of all because many probably expected a little Italy, spaghetti and mandolin which, when faced with difficulties, always turns the other way in the end and instead we have been something else, we are something else and look at this, it's not just a fact of pride is a matter of defense of the national interest, because when you are authoritative, when you are credible your voice is also listened to and when your voice is listened to then yes you can obtain results for your national interest.",
          "A debate has opened up that wasn't there before thanks to the Italian position.",
          "Today you have to accept that there is another government that has been chosen by Italians to carry out exactly the policy it is carrying out.",
          "I consider it a maneuver, consistent with the commitments that we have made with the Italian people.",
          "We must always do better, but I am satisfied with the fact that not even a day has gone by, Saturdays, Sundays, including holidays, without us trying to give at least one answer, always on Italy's side.",
          "And this is the reason why today I sent a letter to the European Council and the European Commission to ask that what we discussed at the last Ukrainian European Council meeting be immediately made concrete, we saw her moved in front of the children's soft toys killed on the bus and you confirmed to Zaleski the full support of the Italian government, despite an important part of public opinion being against the sending of weapons, I was moved by some soft toys in the rain in memory of some children because my daughter has some a similar one and however I also want to tell you that I thought that Italians should be very proud of them instead.",
          "And I asked what the contracts were with which these irregular immigrants that we want to bring into Italy would work and I was told national collective contract.",
          "sorry, no clothing, I'm on holiday, but I thought I should say a few words about the high bills, electricity and gas and inflation which are devastating Italian families and companies.",
          "Furthermore, from my point of view, if you want to bring it into the legal system you should ask the Italians what they think about it and then put it in your next program and then ask the Italians if they give you the majority to carry out these things which should not be the subject of the government of national unity that we needed to do our best to get out of the pandemic.",
          "In short, also so in short, seeing and talking directly with people can help to dismantle a narrative that has been made about the current about the undersigned often and about the Italian government.",
          "The theme here is if you want to do something, whatever you want to do, you do it respecting the rules and laws of the Italian state because there isn't some idiot who respects them and someone else who doesn't have to respect them, this Italy here, as I see it, it's over, that is, someone who knows how to do it better make their proposals but don't use hypotheses that have nothing to do with the rationale of the law and with our intention to prevent this State from saying that we are no longer the banana republic, because I don't follow them on this, I move forward and I believe that this is what Italians expect from me and from the government currently in office",
          "It was the green pass and we contested it and it was made by a left-wing government okay or in any case where there were those who today contest this stuff here, as far as we are concerned, the only principle we want to affirm is that obviously Italian welfare must be distinguished and concentrated on those who cannot work, because those who can work should work.",
          "It's missing because the president of the United States is inadequate, because Europe doesn't exist and even Italy doesn't seem to be giving a great account of itself..",
          "And we must also thank those courageous entrepreneurs who in complex lands try to tell the story of the greatness of the Italian genius, his ability to leave something in the nations in which he builds cooperation.",
          "It is a battle in which Italy continued with determination and this led to the end, despite there being great resistance to bring the whole of Europe to a proposal that in short we were among the first, if not the first, to do, which is a huge signal for Italian and European families and businesses and shows that in short, when you take a little with determination and a little stubbornness the results can come.",
          "the pres is a victory for the Italian government.",
          "We are working on this thanks to the position of the Italian government.",
          "Thanks to the government's latest measure there will be more police officers in almost two hundred hospitals and it is obviously the very first part of an overall reform that we want to carry out on healthcare so that citizens can trust Italian public hospitals again",
          "You immediately realize how much our nation is considered a beacon of civilization, how being Italian is synonymous with beautiful, precious, innovative, brilliant.. And how much demand there is for Italy for years, perhaps for decades we have forgotten what we have been capable of, what we are capable of, how much Italy is capable of surprising, of innovating, of being avant-garde, of teaching how much the our identity, our nation and our homeland are admired and esteemed.",
          "You can dialogue with others, you can respect them, know them in depth, draw enrichment from that dialogue, Italy can and must give.",
          "Presidentialism is not an abstract measure and the most economic measure that Italy needs.",
          "Here are the rules that the Italian government has brought forward that aim to limit the rescue of migrants to what is required by international law, with some fairly simple rules.",
          "we will move forward on this and we are very determined because we know that this is the only way to stop deaths at sea, protect the weakest and guarantee safety and legality for those who live in Italy.",
          "To seriously address this reflection, I think it is important to start from what has happened in Italy in recent decades, no.",
          "If Von Der Line asked Draghi for a study on Europe's competitiveness and this was seen as an anti-Italian government initiative But why not?",
          "On the one hand on the other we must also be aware of a co-coalition bond which requires a great sense of responsibility and we are in government of the nation for us clearly acting Inter, doing our best, acting in Italy's interests is priority.",
          "We have decided to collect the main ones so that every Italian can take stock of our activity.",
          "Perhaps you have some difficulty in explaining to Italians why in a moment like this, in a moment in which we are heading towards a dramatic autumn on a social, economic and cost-of-living level, you are dealing with a matter which, first of all, is not priority at this moment and second point?",
          "and as I was saying, Italy shares the objectives of the double transition, the green transition, the digital transition to obviously deliver to future generations a development model that is intelligent and sustainable.",
          "We wanted to stop by here at the embassy because the work you do is very precious for Italy.",
          "because in the end, at the end of this adventure, I will only be interested in one thing knowing that we have done everything we could do to give Italians a better nation.",
          "The government's action, as demonstrated so far, will be at the contrary focused on respect for the law and national international law, putting an end to the anomalies that have characterized the Italian approach to the migration issue.",
          "What do you expect in Italy from this council?",
          "Everything we have to give we must give to the Italians because we have always believed in the Italians and we were not wrong.",
          "This is why I am even more convinced today that a conservative turn is needed in the West, in the United States, in Europe, in Italy..",
          "But excuse me, so we'll see how things will go and I hope that the Italians will give us the strength not only to, let's say, govern the nation and to be driving forces, to build alliances that will be.",
          "Our Italy is always on the side of honest citizens, it is always ready to help those who have stumbled on the difficult path of life get back on their feet.",
          "We in the classrooms and in the squares will continue to fight to represent all those Italians who ask for answers and who do not give up on this reality.",
          "After the tragedy of Crotone, once again Europe is tearing its clothes but not taking a step, while the opposition severely attacks the government's policy on migrants.",
          "In short, the Council of Ministers, the government are there, the other institutional levels are also there, there is a level of collaboration here which is very precious in a situation like this, it was a tragedy, but we can always be reborn from crises strong and therefore it can also be an opportunity to demonstrate how concrete and immediate Italy knows how to be in terms of damage estimates.",
          "The agreement reached in Europe on the gas price cap is a great Italian victory.",
          "First point, according to the Italian government, the green pass could remain in force until January 2025.",
          "That is, I want an Italy in which to be a good teacher, you don't necessarily have to be a member of the CGIL.",
          "And that is the Italy that we want to encourage.",
          "In the final declarations there are many issues that Italy considers priorities, for which Italy, let's say, had an important role.",
          "Did you expect, after the trips with the Fun de line to Tunis, that France and Germany would suddenly say, keep them, eh?",
          "Doing it with sincerity, with dedication, even with a willingness to sacrifice, led me to be the first female Prime Minister in Italy.. Maybe I could get somewhere else.",
          "I came here simply to tell you that Italy should leave the work you do, on days when you normally don't.",
          "We forget the contribution that Italy has made to the history of humanity.",

          "I therefore confirm that we intend to modify this rule without taking these resources away from their original destination, which is young people and culture.",
          "Those who don't respect the rules pretend not to see criminals.",
          "For them there are only those who would like to work and those who would like to work should be beaten, but who instead commits crimes?",
          "For them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.",
          "It means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "I was also moved.",
          "This means firmly combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, it means protecting those who have the right to international protection and managing legal immigration in an orderly manner through flow decrees.. All within a framework of responsibility that must also involve the other European states.",
          "If you are a cancer patient and want to take a ferry to go for surgery from Sardinia to Rome you cannot get on the ferry and thousands of unvaccinated illegal immigrants disembark.",
          "I mean, there are several companies that ask the government within the flow decree on immigration to let in some immigrants who they need to do jobs.",
          "businesses and citizens left respectively with tax credits and blocked jobs who are prisoners of the frequent regulatory changes.",
          "We do this to comply with international law.",
          "Obviously we want to respect international law.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "And for this reason I reiterate that the government does not intend to bow to the many and powerful pressures of those who would like to impose the ideological vision of a world without national borders in the name of an indefinite right to migrate.",
          "The government does not intend to change its position on the issue of immigration.",
          "This, from my point of view, changes many things in the European approach to the migration issue.",
          "Immigration is a European problem and needs a European response.",
          "Well, I am moved, I am often moved, but I found many people moved, clearly moved by the tragedy they were experiencing, but also moved by Speranza No and I was saying for us it is important to give immediate answers.",
          "I think of the fact that we have had concrete references, for example to migration issues, in line with what is the Rome process, our conference on development and migration with India, the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Arabia Saudi, United Emirates.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from Ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "also on the topic of citizenship income I want to try to be clear because I know that this is a city in which no, there are many recipients of citizenship income and I want to say to these people don't be afraid because I don't want to leave anyone behind.",
          "Well, starting next week we are working on new rules to stop trafficking, because we don't intend to give up on this issue.",
          "as far as the rule on raves is concerned, look, I agree with what I heard the plant minister Tosi say if I'm not mistaken today in an interview if anyone has ideas to improve the rule and Parliament exists for this,",
          "We do not want in any way to continue to favor human traffickers.",
          "Now this is a topic on which I have read and heard a lot of controversy and many falsehoods and I think it is useful to clarify things a little.. First, they do not lose their citizenship income.",
          "We are used to an Italy that is mainly concerned with going in search of migrants throughout the Mediterranean.",
          "We need rules to prevent that um, in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",
          "But to carry out this commitment it is necessary to know data and numbers, to understand in depth the scenario in which to move, to have in our eyes and hearts the stories of those who suffer abuse, persecution, violence.",
          "Which can happen within national borders.",
          "We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",
          "They must go to families who do not have the possibility of having a home and who often find themselves sleeping under a bridge because the public housing is occupied by criminal families.",
          "International law provides something very clear: you are obliged to save someone if you accidentally meet them and if someone is at risk.",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "And because on this yes, on this I and my opposition say we are completely in two different worlds, the State that harasses people who try to work respecting the rules and then pretend not to see those who respect these rules, if these rules don't give a damn, it's finished.",
          "And I say this because for years here we have been told that there was the tragedy of refugees faced with images of boats full of single men of working age.",
          "We were not warned that this vessel was in danger of sinking.",
          "What happens if these rules are not respected is that there is no authorization to enter international waters and if that authorization is violated the vessel is administratively detained the first time for two months, the second time with seizure for the purposes of confiscation.",
          "The decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",
          "We want to fight human trafficking, we want to fight illegal entries, we want to fight deaths at sea.",
          "The immigration emergency, just as the Nigerian mafia emergency never existed, just as the emergency of drug dealers who continued to camp out in the middle of the streets, even when Italians were locked inside their homes, never existed.",
          "If you don't have the green pass, then we had a virus that came from China, but we don't want to import the Chinese model.",
          "Preventing people from having fun as I have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",
          "the immigration issue.",
          "Um, obviously beyond the issue of respect for international law, the value of sovereignty and freedom of a nation.",
          "Yes, these people with us instead of the citizen's income of taking the citizen's income without working while staying at home, um, they will be helped to actually find a job for those who know poverty.",
          "Why the drafts The draft conclusions If we look at the past on the topic of the external dimension, on the topic of the fact that the migration issue is a European issue on the topic of the specificity of the maritime border, which obviously needs different responses, it is a huge step ahead of the past.",
          "I heard that we want to ban demonstrations.",
          "But refugees are not about welcoming a community, giving hospitality to a community that in Italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules.",
          "for those who hire women or young people up to thirty-six years old or recipients of citizenship income.",
          "Around twenty-five thousand people, but also in Campania around one hundred and eight thousand new hires are expected and therefore there seems to be some possibility of finding employment.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "Let's say for culture, as they say, we want to abolish it etc.",
          "There are many more who have lost their citizenship income.",
          "No, it would not be the barricades on the Bolkestein, that is, which liberalizes the public concessions of the sea.",
          "This is what we called the Mattei plan, that is, a cooperation strategy that is centered on an equal relationship, a relationship of mutual growth and interest to guarantee African populations the fundamental right not to be forced to migrate in search of a better life.",
          "risk that at a certain point someone decides to free the world from this very dangerous person, because maybe there are some wheels out of place and he doesn't understand the game there is.",
          "What this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",
          "those which are no longer compensable and which no one wants to take and which therefore they are currently not transferable.",
          "Have your beautiful party with the people who can contain the area according to the regulations.",
          "It also means hitting the traffickers who are behind it.",
          "The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",
          "Also, sorry, but how is this defense of illegal raves compatible in your opinion?",
          "That is, very few people have been relocated in recent months, so it's a bit like, let's say, a Linus blanket.",
          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "But I also want to tell you that the issue of so-called relocations is secondary in the very complex situation we are facing.",
          "According to data from the scientific evaluation committee of the P n R R of the Ministry of Labour, there are approximately fifty percent of the recipients of citizenship income and practically none of these people have found a job thanks to those mythological Navigators which are another brilliant idea of ​​the Five Star Movement.",
          "That is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",
          "Then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the Mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "But this was certainly the case with regards to the migration dossier.",

          "But this is also false, because for these people the new support for training and work starts on September 1st to help them enter the job market.",
          "Those who are able to work must be trained and must be able to respond to job requests coming from companies.",
          "It is done by allowing them to have a job, a decent job, a well-paid job that can help them grow regardless of the condition from which they come.",
          "After that, this story that is making the rounds makes me particularly laugh, so on this document notes for a conservative program practically this sentence is written, namely that young people will no longer be able to choose whether to work or not, but will be bound to accepting a job proposal for the loss of any benefit which has become a thing for which you, in short the jobs you have to do forced labor.",

          "So there are still options for those who clearly want to get busy who sign up to the platform, provided they haven't found a job in the meantime, because in all this there is a fact that struck me and that I want to share with you.",

          "But those who can work are instead included in a job training course, with a reimbursement of expenses during the training period and with important incentives for those who hire them.",
          "That is, we come from legislatures in which we were essentially told that work could be created by decree, that poverty could be eliminated by decree.",
          "But for others what is needed is the training and tools necessary to encourage hiring.",
          "A virtuous mechanism that can push companies to hire this means fewer unemployed people paid for by the State and it means new taxpayers who pay taxes because the most formidable, but also the most dignified citizen's income that can be given to those who are able to work and the salary that arrives every month thanks to the work that has been done.",
