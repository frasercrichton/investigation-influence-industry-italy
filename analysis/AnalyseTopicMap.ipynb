And then, obviously, we talked about the resources of how to best spend the resources of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, as well as in the face of the difficulties that exist, increase in the costs of raw materials, inflation., we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another., The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.]  \n",

       "8   [what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes., Last week's average price of petrol in Italy was one euro eight hundred and twelve thirty of May two thousand and twenty-two we had petrol at one euro eight and eighty five higher than the average price of the last week on the twenty-seventh of June last year we had the average price of petrol at two euros and seventy-three on the eighteenth of July it has one euro nine point eight eight average price on the first of August at one point eight point seven seven in the last week the average was one euro eight hundred and twelve then I can also understand that this price is considered high, that it is consider it perhaps out of control, but where was the press, communication, politicians when the average price of petrol was two euros and seventy-three on average or when it was at one euro eight hundred and eighty and I'll tell you more where it was in recent years because for example we also had the average price of one euro and eighty in March, Two thousand and twelve, Monti government in March, Two thousand and thirteen, Monti government in March, Two thousand and fourteen Renzi government and I don't remember the campaigns we are seeing in these days., And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]  \n",

And then maybe there are people who honestly try to do their job, who are harassed by the State, a bit of healthy fair competition.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]</td>\n",

And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]</td>\n",

Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.]  \n",

Because Russia is certainly a particular nation also, especially if we look at it from our point of view, no, it went from the system of the tsars directly to the communist dictatorship and then let's say after in the in the post-communist period it moved on to systems, let's say that in any case they are far from being liberal, but this cannot mean that Dostoievski is not to be considered part of European culture.]  \n",

And the data arriving from the labor market are encouraging from this point of view., Those over sixty, as has also been said, do not lose their citizenship income, those with dependent minor children, as has been said and written, nor do those with particularly fragile conditions.. All these people, unlike what has been instrumentally said, continue to receive income until the end of the year and will then pass on to the inclusion allowance, the new support measure that the government has launched and with which they lose nothing who stops receiving income.]  \n",

          "Because allow me, gentlemen, a nation in which there are two states of emergency at the same time is grotesque, especially if it is a democracy.",
          "It was the green pass and we contested it and it was made by a left-wing government okay or in any case where there were those who today contest this stuff here, as far as we are concerned, the only principle we want to affirm is that obviously Italian welfare must be distinguished and concentrated on those who cannot work, because those who can work should work.",
          "Then we will meet President Bonaccini again on Tuesday and also the various territorial economic representatives and we will also try to get them to tell us what the most urgent things are.",
          "Because if obviously they reimburse me more than I spend, I will be required not to control how much I spend, because what do I care?",
          "Laura Boldrini it is let's say, a modern enough right to be able to govern by expressing Giorgia Meloni, prime minister No, soon we will see the messages, we will see the polls which in any case already anticipate you, they give brothers of Italy this first Italian party.",
          "And those public budgets are the state budget, but they are also the budgets of local authorities.",
          "That is, it means that families spent more to buy less.",

          "I think masks continue to be useful, let's say the model of deprivation of freedoms that we have known in the past did not seem so effective to me and I think the Chinese case demonstrates this well.",
          "P n R r. It is not blocked in Italy just as it was not blocked in France.",
          "Because if you are the first to say that we will lose it is difficult for the voters to believe in the victory in Lucca, for example, where we were united, we also managed to aggregate civic lists from various backgrounds.",
          "After that I also hear people say but here we don't have the money for the Italians and instead we spend the money on weapons.",
          "This is because I am told that this is a limitation of women's self-determination.",

          "we are at the end of the election campaign and I really couldn't have done more.",
          "something new has been added in recent weeks, namely that this government has started its own.",
          "Every now and then see what happens outside of us to also be proud of the sacrifices we have made of what we have built and and and and of the great nation that we are.",
          "as far as the rule on raves is concerned, look, I agree with what I heard the plant minister Tosi say if I'm not mistaken today in an interview if anyone has ideas to improve the rule and Parliament exists for this,",
          "But those who can work are instead included in a job training course, with a reimbursement of expenses during the training period and with important incentives for those who hire them.",
          "We decided to take stock of our work.",
          "Because the scenes of degradation, abandonment, confusion that we sometimes see in a difficult moment in our lives, that is, when we need emergency healthcare, are not tolerable.",
          "But look, I think it's certainly a very interesting scenario.",
          "As you know, I wanted to organize the first institutional visit of the Italian government outside its national borders here in Brussels.",

          "The reason why you will not govern with Italian brothers is that we are the ones who don't want it.",

          "I just want to say one thing that is related to what was said before me.",
          "I want to tell the women of this nation that the fact of always or almost always being underestimated is a great advantage, because yes, they often don't see you coming and we must be aware of this advantage, as long as we are not.",
          "We want to start again from respect for the dignity, the uniqueness and sacredness of every single human being, because each of us has a unique and unrepeatable genetic code.",
          "This is also work that we intend to carry forward, continue to carry forward in the coming weeks because the era in which the State turns the other way in the face of crime and those who do not respect the rules is over.. Public housing buildings should go to those in need, not to the families of criminals.",
          "Unfortunately this impacts everyone, even the companies that have to take those credits, even those who have received the super bonus, even those who have not received the super bonus, on citizens.",
          "Italy has worked a lot in recent years, above all with the aim of representing more, how can I say, a limit rather than a stimulus to the creation of wealth.",
          "a hiring incentive, i.e.",
          "We no longer intend to remain under the blackmail of unscrupulous smugglers who use migrants as human shields for their trafficking and we no longer intend to let these criminals decide who can arrive in Italy and who cannot.",

          "I can't give you different opportunities.",
          "I say this with the respect I have for Mario Draghi, that of all the possible and imaginable matters he decides to place his trust in the existence of the government on this matter which also betrays a problem.",
          "Because I don't know if the issue is to necessarily insult Giorgia Meloni and let's say demonstrate in this way that you don't have many arguments or if the issue is that the Democratic Party really believes the things it is saying and writing, in which case they are let's say much worse than what we believed then.",
          "Look, we made a maneuver of thirty billion out of those thirty billion, we invested twenty on what we had declared to be the priority and on which everyone agreed, which was the high bills.",
          "But let's add a further one percent cut to the tax wedge, which therefore reaches three percent for incomes up to twenty thousand euros.",
          "Simply because we need to face reality again",
          "Then, thank you.",
          "If Von Der Line asked Draghi for a study on Europe's competitiveness and this was seen as an anti-Italian government initiative But why not?",

          "Happy two thousand twenty-three!",
          "The example Italy intends to set an example at a European and international level.",
          "But for others what is needed is the training and tools necessary to encourage hiring.",
          "On my first bilateral trip, to Asia since the beginning of the mandate of the seventy-fifth anniversary of our bilateral relations, I'm sure.",
          "What they have is a hegemony of power.",
          "What do you think now?",
          "Sometimes I too was almost convinced that yes, maybe no, my place was somewhere else.",
          "But excuse me, so we'll see how things will go and I hope that the Italians will give us the strength not only to, let's say, govern the nation and to be driving forces, to build alliances that will be.",
          "But look, I don't know this.",
          "But it has a broader value thanks to the discounts that the government has obtained from large-scale retailers.",

          "He says the kebabs, we didn't sell the kebabs.",
          "and so we have to thank you.",
          "What does applying prevention mean?",
          "Yes, everyone knew where it was and they took it.",
          "It was not necessary to deprive our children, the young people of their sociality, of the education of their normality.",
          "The strength and solidity of our democracies was made possible precisely by the end of those totalitarianisms and by the sacrifice of all those people who fought and fought, allowing us to live in a free world.",
          "So it's important to, understand that if we are called to govern this nation we will do it for everyone.",
          "May I ask you a question?",
          "And that's exactly what we're trying to do.",
          "It seems clear to me that for several months we have been witnessing a migratory pressure that has few precedents across the central Mediterranean, towards Europe and therefore towards Italy.",
          "I'm sorry that I had to convene them on Sunday, but unfortunately it was impossible for us, for me and for Minister Giorgetti who at the ecofin to convene them first, however, in short, everything is organized and I trust we can move forward.",
          "And we have decided to introduce harsher penalties for those who attack healthcare workers.",
          "I mean, internal political issues, no, the fact of privileging one's internal public opinions.",
          "We must intervene immediately.",
          "Good morning.",
          "A protection tool is useful for those who are not able to work, it is useful for those over sixty, it is useful for the disabled, for families without income who have dependent minors.",
          "Because the great objective that we have always given ourselves in life and that we have given ourselves as a political force, was to ensure that Italians could once again be proud of being Italian, of waving the tricolor flag",
          "Can we celebrate Andrea a little since we've been celebrating for so long?",
          "You are great ambassadors of Italian culture, but above all for what you do for your nation.",
          "This is one of our many missions.",
          "Okay, that's a risk that the Italian State ran as we know because there were rulings from the Constitutional Court of the ECHR, the European Court which said that prison imprisonment is essentially unconstitutional and with the fall of the previous government there was a risk of not arriving in time with a parliamentary amendment that would secure this fundamental tool in the fight against the mafia.",
          "We are used to an Italy that is mainly concerned with going in search of migrants throughout the Mediterranean.",
          "So in any case even during that period you have coverage and this is obviously accompanied by real support measures for companies that hire from cutting the tax wedge to advantageous taxation with the formula that we call the more you hire, the less you pay.",
          "Anyone who turns to an employment center or employment agency must be immediately directed to a training course that has strong prospects of rapid hiring once the training course is finished.",
          "To me it seems like a sign of attention and respect, of respect.",
          "I'm sorry I made you get up so early this morning.",
          "Less difficult.",
          "Yet it is estimated that every year around eighty thousand cats and fifty thousand dogs are abandoned, more than eighty percent of which risk dying from accidents or starvation.. Pets are part of the family in every respect and Brothers of Italy intends to fight to guarantee them a dignified and loving life among our initiatives already launched in this legislature.",
          "I was hoping it would go well.",
          "No, so to speak, emergency communication from Frontex has reached our authorities.",
          "For them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "We do not want in any way to continue to favor human traffickers.",
          "Thank you very much.",
          "Obviously at the institute of the house of culture thanks to Brexit.",
          "Mrs. Boldrini, however, gives us something even more fantastic.",
          "Matteo, many words thanks to you.",
          "But no one says that, for example in this financial measure for the first time there is a good measure against open-and-close companies, that is, against that plague which in Italy is worth billions of euros, of Eva, of tax evasion every year, of companies that open and close before the State begins to carry out checks, that is, on average after two years they do not pay a single euro to the Italian State, disappear and start again.",
          "It consists of voluntary registration on a platform that gives you access to various possibilities, participating in a training program during which you also receive an economic benefit of three hundred and fifty euros per month, or the possibility of participating in the national civil service even beyond the age that comes normally permitted for the civil service which also recognizes an economic benefit, the possibility of participating in public utility projects also with the recognition of an economic benefit.",
          "Because we want to break this track",
          "I am sorry.",
          "And that is the Italy that we want to encourage.",
          "But this was certainly the case with regards to the migration dossier.",
          "I usually tell the truth.",
          "In times of globalization, Italy cannot set itself the objective of competing on the quantity of what it produces, but there is one thing on which the rest of the world does not compete.. With Italy being the quality of what we produce, the brand is the most precious thing we have.",
          "cap on cash.",
          "You should remember that it is thanks to the policies you have made.",
          "In the final declarations there are many issues that Italy considers priorities, for which Italy, let's say, had an important role.",
          "This is why Brothers of Italy proposes a Copernican revolution in the relations between the State and businesses.",
          "So we intervened and continue to intervene.",
          "For example, with Covid it is possible to seriously tax extra profits or in any case seriously recover the proceeds of those taxes, given that so far one billion out of the ten expected has been collected due to a rule that was evidently not written quite well.",
          "We will protect the house from foreclosures, illegal construction and also from assets disguised by the left",
          "This is the reason why our government has already intervened, increasing the bonus from one hundred and ten percent to ninety percent.",
          "Within this event on this day there are also international meetings, particularly with some leaders of the Western Balkans, another quadrant in which the government is very busy.",
          "But look, if I had presented myself with a structured counter-proposal from the government it would have been said that I didn't want to allow the opposition to do theirs, just as when I proposed to make a comparison with in I was accused of wanting to make the opposition withdraw the proposal.",
          "We also do it to respect migrants, because if someone is risking their life they have the right to be saved.",
          "We obviously have to thank those who risk it every day.",
          "We won and I am happy that precisely in Lucca as in Gorizia, in Pistoia, L'Aquila and in many other cities that the centre-right won, in which it reconfirmed the brother mayors of Italy, it drove the coalition.",
          "I believe that, in short, let's say it is a fundamental condition that disabled children obviously have more than others and therefore we have made VAT on all products a structural measure.",
          "Already during the pandemic, criminal credit has spread, now the exponential increase in prices.",
          "HI.",
          "We go around leaving a piece of Italy and this is the reason why we have, I mean, this ability to build solid relationships from those relationships.",
          "this is written in Giorgio Meloni's book for those who don't want to do propaganda and for those who are interested, let's say, in talking about serious topics without having to hit someone just because they dislike them.",
          "We don't intend to do that.",
          "huge increases in costs for citizens and businesses, electricity and gas bills tripled, thousands of businesses exhausted and without concrete help will be forced to permanently close, millions of workers at risk.",
          "We desperately need the youth of this nation.",
          "In detail, however, well, it was to tell you that I am happy with the climate that I found here in Brussels.",
          "I am proud and I believe that Italians should be proud because it is Italy.",
          "The point is that the measure was written so badly and made so badly that it generated an enormous series of problems that we today have inherited and are required to try to resolve because the super bonus essentially had two big errors.",
          "And that's what we could do.",
          "Unthinkable.",
          "I am sincerely close to the pain of those who have lost loved ones and to the communities that have been most affected.",
          "Because today we also live this absurdity.",
          "But it is true that diplomacy is lacking from this point of view and is lacking for the credibility of Western leadership.",

          "Istat says that in June the employment rate reached a new record of sixty-one point five percent, with an increase in employment in the first six months of this year of two hundred and ninety-two thousand people.",
          "And finally we deal with the work of people with disabilities, supporting the bodies that accompany them and allocating resources to encourage their hiring.",
          "But look, I can't tell you if the category of optimism, let's say, has ever fully belonged to me, in the sense that it has also been my strength..",
          "Widespread petty crime, violence, open-air drug dealing, baby gangs, streets, squares, sometimes entire neighborhoods completely abandoned to decay and removed from state control, often handed over to the putrid rules of the mafia and organized crime.",
          "They say because we didn't want to enter into the government's competences, let's say it seems a bit more like a game of craps to me, as if to say in our opinion it should be done, but then you see it for yourself, then serious things from this point of view are done with roofing.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "The government does not intend to change its position on the issue of immigration.",

          "So let's say about what has been done the most with a maximum threshold of forty thousand euros, which means that the measure is a measure aimed at the middle class.",
          "After that, this story that is making the rounds makes me particularly laugh, so on this document notes for a conservative program practically this sentence is written, namely that young people will no longer be able to choose whether to work or not, but will be bound to accepting a job proposal for the loss of any benefit which has become a thing for which you, in short the jobs you have to do forced labor.",

          "Instead it reached historic highs and failed as an active labor policy measure, given that very few of the recipients of the citizen's income were eventually hired and found a decent job.",
          "We talk about all this, we look for our proposals, we do things, we question ourselves, we compare ourselves, etc.",
          "In the sense leek that then the first possible negotiation point when we were talking about this topic of negotiation, even in this interview that I heard, reference was made to the fact that the State was actually negotiating the dismantling of the impediment prison of forty-one bis, of the quart- of the hard prison.",
          "I believe that a further evaluation needs to be made and we would say to focus particular attention on the parliamentarians on mission, that is, on those who have a double role.",

          "No, our sense of belonging, the awareness of the community that we are, of the value that that community has a nation in which we said yesterday in the conference of ambassadors, when we go outside our own national borders we realize how much we we are considered the only place where we don't realize how much we are considered.",
          "The blanket was so short.",
          "It's unthinkable, but who knows and how we see it, everyone else sees it too.",
          "That is, to establish an instrument that also guarantees self-employed people, in the event of closure of their VAT number, an unemployment benefit.",
          "The question is whether you accept it.",
          "To defend this wealth we first need to protect our farmers by promoting supply chain contracts that guarantee adequate remuneration for the agricultural product.",

          "Because this is one of those cases in which the entire supply chain has set to work and the municipalities must be thanked, the INPS must be thanked, the post office must be thanked, the agri-food supply chain, the merchants and large-scale retail trade must be thanked.",
          "Another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "It should have been done months ago, but some members, among the very presentable ones, according to a certain Europeanism, didn't want it because it wasn't convenient for them.",
          "And I have proposed a much broader discussion that also involves those who are constitutionally, let's say, more equipped to do this work, which is the CNEL, to finish before the start of the budget law, therefore also in time to obviously and possibly have the coverage necessary to take action.",
          "In short, a captivating title, a result that risks being counterproductive.",
          "In my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, I'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "Is this a question that might seem mean?",
          "I am thinking of the issue of strengthening the lowest wages, particularly with the cut in the contribution wedge.",

          "If you get into difficulty you will be helped and not harassed.",
          "We chose to do a difficult campaign because those themes were complex, they were more difficult to localize.",
          "Because the reality we live in is making things difficult.",
          "In reality we don't want to abolish it.",
          "But then why didn't we accept the opposition's proposal on the legal minimum wage as it was presented?",
          "What does it mean to seek visibility.",
          "And for this reason I reiterate that the government does not intend to bow to the many and powerful pressures of those who would like to impose the ideological vision of a world without national borders in the name of an indefinite right to migrate.",
          "And already in the first months of the legislature, despite the inevitably limited resources we have available, we have given signals in this sense, interventions to protect the purchasing power of families and workers, the renewal of the two-point cut percentages of the tax and contribution wedge which it is worth remembering the previous government had foreseen until the end of last year and the addition of a further point of the contribution cut for the lowest incomes.",
          "We have chosen to be different from you, alternative to you.",
          "Fair work, paid adequately as this government has particularly demonstrated, putting most of its resources on cutting the contribution wedge, guaranteeing adequate wages and defending the purchasing power of families is one of our absolute priorities.",
          "But this is exactly what I asked the CNEL to study in sixty days, to understand which is the most effective rule that allows me to help those who are below the threshold, the threshold without compromising those who are above.",
          "And I return to the topic because you see, it's a fact.",
          "I return for example to the energy question.",
          "We talked at length, about the mistakes made in the past and how we need to somehow reverse the trend today in terms of, for example, security for the economy of our societies in terms of supply chains.",
          "So we are already working on the budget law.",
          "And I find it frankly surreal.",
          "With all the battle about safety in the workplace, the safety of workers, the safety of those who go out and participate in any initiative, food safety, why not this too?",
          "But now it's a matter of better organizing the entire supply chain and therefore also talking to each other more.",
          "the defense of the national identity of our future also involves the defense of the territory, of nature, of the beauty in which we are immersed.",
          "Don't you think there was a political signal?",
          "Look, people have very little money.",
          "We wanted to strengthen the State's attention towards the sick and the world of disabilities from the Pact for the elderly which lays the foundations for an overall reform of policies in favor of the elderly, up to the increase in minimum pensions.",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "Because we have chosen to be who we are.",
          "In this way, self-employed people who lose their jobs are protected and undeclared work is discouraged, always on the side of those who work, in whatever form they do so.",
          "The more we advance, the more we will reach out to those left behind.",
          "We have to work day by day, but we're here, thank you.",
          "Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "We are doing our best, as can be seen even today.",
          "Then first, in short, did we get carried away?",
          "For them there are only those who would like to work and those who would like to work should be beaten, but who instead commits crimes?",
          "I believe that this depends on the value and ability of the investigators.",
          "So we are moving exactly in this direction.",
          "At this stage it is essential that we work together for safety and economic security.",
          "It is therefore necessary, from this point of view, to accompany the current formulation of the law to its expiry according to the principle of legitimate expectations, i.e.",
          "And above all, let it be known that the only reason why we want to get to the top is that we know that from there we can look further.",
          "Increases that can even reach one hundred euros for workers with the lowest incomes.",
          "In these over two years I have never done an interview in the foreign press because I was in opposition to the government and I would not have spoken badly about my nation in the foreign press.",
          "These are obviously first steps towards the objective that the government has set itself, which is obviously to increase workers' wages, guaranteeing decent wages, wages that are adequate for the work performed and the socio-economic context.",
          "Above all, politics, a good part of politics, has been able to take advantage of your example.",
          "We are not victims of that prejudice, as long as we do not consider that the role that others have defined for us is also the role to which we can aspire.",
          "From us they will have every possible support, as we have always demonstrated throughout our history.",
          "Frankly, among other things, it wouldn't make sense on such an important measure.",
          "If you are capable, don't keep running away.",
          "But frankly, all the possible evil is attributed to the tones, the contents, the contrasts which seem to me to follow in tone the deadly anger of the other side, that is, Putin Kiril.",
          "We are the autonomous, free right, capable of building its own proposal that is different from that of everyone else, but which everyone else will have to deal with.",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "We have established the principle that those who cannot work must have assistance, but those who can work must have work from the increase in the number of families who could access discounts on bills to the resources to combat the expensive shopping cart, through the experimentation of food income.",
          "Because every light turned on and every shutter raised are safeguards of legality and the fight against degradation.",
          "on Labor Day the government chooses to work, chooses to work to provide answers to those workers and to those who legitimately aspire to improve their condition.",
          "From the beginning it is the reason why in this, in these less than a year, we have concentrated the few resources we had at our disposal on cutting the contribution wedge, that is, putting more money in people's paychecks.",
          "that they are the same for everyone, as we have already done in the midst of the pandemic, for example by immediately proposing the introduction of an instrument for the protection of VAT numbers that was based on the same rules as the redundancy fund.",
          "And so if someone expects not, do you feel a bit like Cinderella?",
          "Do you consider it a hypothesis?",
          "The point is you can only get anywhere, which you don't have to accept.",
          "How much does it cost?",
          "We introduce job vouchers in the agricultural sectors of the UCA sector and personal care, in particular with regard to jobs, jobs, housework up to ten thousand euros.",
          "obviously beyond the issue of respect for international law, the value of sovereignty and freedom of a nation.",
          "So discourses that seem ideologically different come together precisely on this violent tone from conquerors to misogyny.",
          "Important rules on safety at work, on school-work alternation, on the safety of students who participate in school-work alternation, incentives for hiring young people equal to sixty percent of the salary they earn.",
          "Only if you are aware of what you are.",
          "And this seems to me to be one of those cases.",
          "However, we are immediately committed to introducing a mechanism for super deducting the cost of labor for those who increase the number of employed compared to previous years.",
          "We have seen the results in recent years of the work you have done.",
          "We are the first green agriculture in Europe, we possess a heritage of typicality, quality, food safety, care of the territory which must absolutely be protected and valorised.",
          "For the other it was a bolt from the blue, but this is false because what we did was not only written in the center-right government program, but was included in the budget law that was passed last December.",
          "It is an important team effort that must continue with the same determination from tomorrow.",
          "With a simple and responsible proposal, namely to adequately strengthen the instrument of the single universal allowance.",
          "Well, by reducing the tax wedge, i.e.",
          "Probable and desirable?",
          "If in these first months we were obviously, how can I say it, in a centrifuge, no, that is, we took over the government at a very particular moment.",
          "We are the coherence that has never been betrayed.",
          "I apologize for the addition of the protections guaranteed to workers, but a substitute parameter, a single parameter, and in our system a parameter of this type would risk, paradoxically, creating worse conditions for many workers than those they have today and paradoxically doing them a favor to large economic concentrations in which it is appropriate to review workers' rights downwards.",
          "We must always do more.",
          "So today and until the end of this year, we have a cut in the contribution wedge of six percentage points for those with incomes of up to thirty-five thousand euros and even of seven percentage points for the lowest incomes of up to twenty-five thousand euros.",
          "We will be able to strengthen and",
          "Above all, director, as you know, the issue of employee employment was our priority.",
          "I hope you know that you can count on your homeland.",
          "And do you spend the day insulting or mystifying?",
          "I say But there is, you won't realize how lunatic you are, Do you realize that you make yourselves ridiculous?",
          "The work that we are doing here, that you are doing here is enormous work.",
          "Okay, so let's forget that cutting the tax wedge, money on families, money on the health fund, anything you can think of couldn't be done.",
          "Homework is good measures, they are useful measures.",
          "In moments like these, we are aware of what our armed forces have built in this territory.",
          "And you know, let's say that constitutionally a law that imposes greater burdens also needs individualized coverage.",
          "We leave a mark of our passage.",
          "I think that, in short, excellent work has been done here.",
          "However, there are some Porro matters on which politics should take a back seat for a moment.",
          "In short, we hope to do what we can, adding at this point also your personal commitment, you know, you know?",
          "I don't know what foreign leader of a foreign nation that isn't mine, which is exactly what everyone else does.",
          "you will never find us looking down with our heads bowed asking your permission to be who we are.",
          "I can announce to you now that the budget law that we will present follows the trend of the previous one, that is, work income, which is what we have already done with all the main provisions of the previous one, starting from the extension of the audience of those who benefited, of the bonus for gas and electricity, up to, let's say, the first signals we have given on productivity bonuses.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "But I repeat, politics doesn't do this or politics does it marginally and what politics does can only do because there are people who every day decide to sacrifice a little piece of themselves for this homeland, for this nation..",
          "After that, for goodness sake, they are choices that others make.",
          "our work is a work that will see the Minister of Health as one of the important points of reference, who has personified, in these two years, what our choices mean in favor of the safety of citizens in favor of a safety that has guaranteed freedom in favor of a security that guaranteed freedom.",

          "I've also heard it said but these poor kids can no longer have fun in Italy they will have to go abroad so look, I'll read you a message that I received today from a common citizen who says It's not that you can't do rap of course you can open your VAT number, rent or buy the place, hire a company that takes care of your security, hire legal staff.",

          "The cup is handed over to Simone Giannelli And here we have a photographer who obscures us.",
          "You immediately realize how much our nation is considered a beacon of civilization, how being Italian is synonymous with beautiful, precious, innovative, brilliant.. And how much demand there is for Italy for years, perhaps for decades we have forgotten what we have been capable of, what we are capable of, how much Italy is capable of surprising, of innovating, of being avant-garde, of teaching how much the our identity, our nation and our homeland are admired and esteemed.",
          "for Italy in recent years we always said yesterday no on development cooperation, that is, when there is no water there are those who bring bottles of water and there are those who bring a dinner, that is, those who want to leave the autonomy the freedom of the nations in which it cooperates, so that that nation can grow and the sign of Italian cooperation has always been like this.",

          "punctual like clockwork in the aftermath of the local elections effectively won by a centre-right led by brothers from Italy.",
          "But the truth is that in recent years our freedom and the very existence of thousands of Italian companies have not been sacrificed to scientific evidence.",
          "Italy is not afraid of women who did not ask for quotas in every area but asked for services and meritocracy.",
          "But there is a problem that when the state does something it is never free, because the money it spends is taxpayers' money and therefore when it spends money it puts it on one side and takes it away from the other.. Do you know how much it cost for every single Italian, around two thousand euros, just under two thousand euros?",
          "There is no need to reach an agreement with the mafia to beat it, it can be done and today Italy has demonstrated it.",
          "It was ideological fury that made Italy what we saw in this, particularly in this last year, because the solutions were there and we had proposed them and we must each assume our own responsibilities.",
          "And which can be projected from now to the political elections it will be difficult to do without brothers of Italy in the pro- in the next legislature.",
          "I don't agree, the left in Italy has a hegemony of power which is another thing, that is, the left has built a society in which by occupying, let's say a series of spaces, an Italy is built, so whoever is anyone who thinks differently is considered a kind of pariah in society and I believe that this is the problem, that is, in the end perhaps the hypothesis of a real change,",

          "The left rises up because according to them the publication of that video is a violation of the dignity of the victim, now given that I took that video from one of the main Italian newspapers, given that since I am very attentive to these things, I published that video only and exclusively because no one was seen, in reality no one is recognised, the victim is not recognised, the video is substantially blacked out.",
          "In other words, if we have to laugh, let's laugh at Meloni who is much funnier than Salvini, a real joker.",
          "as a national team.",
          "Gianmarco.",
          "Cross on the symbol of Brothers of Italy.",
          "We will do it for all Italians.",

          "Simone Giannelli approaches My mother You were fat.",
          "Look, he's wearing the tricolor!",

          "What I can say is that a centre-right government led by the brothers of Italy would do everything it could to continue this process and to allow Chico to at least finally be able to see his daughter.",
          "The results once again disprove the predictions and make us responsible to do more and more, to do better, aware as we are that a strong and credible Italy outside national borders means above all an Italy capable of affirming the interests and needs of its citizens.",
          "I happened to say I am an Italian patriot.",
          "I am satisfied with the way in which Italy is welcomed, listened to with attention, as befits a great international player who has clear positions on all the issues we face",

          "If Fabio Fazio decides to leave Rai to go and work somewhere where they pay him more, he tells you that you are authoritarian.",
          "These are the facts, the facts and what a hope he got it all wrong because he never wanted to listen to the serious proposals that came from brothers in Italy.",
          "It is not the first point according to what results it has brought, that is, other nations which have not bent the rights of the people in this way, which have not taken the debate to such extremes, which have not pitted Italians against each other, but which have only explained I want see who is sixty-six percent.",
          "For this reason I will ask Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi to meet as soon as possible to avoid further divisions.",

          "It looks like a Lancia y with the four position indicators lit that was trumpeting and trying to make its way through the intense city traffic.",
          "The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.",
          "A few days ago I read the news of clashes between the forces of the Libyan ministry and human traffickers.",
          "What this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",
          "In Milan, a public housing complex was cleared, a total of ninety-one illegal occupations and a school building that was entirely occupied by non-EU citizens.",
          "Which historically we say is easier for them to hide where they grew up.",
          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "The causes are multiple, we obviously know the political instability, economic crises which are obviously aggravated by the international conflict and last but not least I continue to denounce the interests of powerful criminal trafficking organizations which often have transnational projections.",
          "Preventing people from having fun as I have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",
          "Because it being understood that what we know is what you heard from Undersecretary Mantovani regarding this matter, these people, were not in a position to be saved by someone who did not want to save them, as unfortunately it seems to me that some people want to say.",
          "among the many falsehoods that I have heard in recent hours is the one according to which these people have been shipwrecked due to the government's measures on non-governmental organizations.",
          "How does my culture offend you?",
          "What happens if these rules are not respected is that there is no authorization to enter international waters and if that authorization is violated the vessel is administratively detained the first time for two months, the second time with seizure for the purposes of confiscation.",
          "I mean, there are several companies that ask the government within the flow decree on immigration to let in some immigrants who they need to do jobs.",
          "Who are those who need protection?",
          "Mass immigration is a phenomenon of very wide scope, which obviously concerns the lives of migrants, which concerns the protection of the most vulnerable, but which also concerns the safety of citizens and the social protection of our societies.",
          "Which First Nations provide assistance?",
          "That is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",
          "They must go to families who do not have the possibility of having a home and who often find themselves sleeping under a bridge because the public housing is occupied by criminal families.",
          "An instability that penalizes us in relations with other states because it clearly makes us appear less credible.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "It means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "Well, starting next week we are working on new rules to stop trafficking, because we don't intend to give up on this issue.",
          "Clear information on rescue mechanisms is needed.",
          "Here are the rules that the Italian government has brought forward that aim to limit the rescue of migrants to what is required by international law, with some fairly simple rules.",
          "A right that is unable to distance itself from the extremism that surrounds it and infiltrates it.",
          "It is done by allowing them to have a job, a decent job, a well-paid job that can help them grow regardless of the condition from which they come.",
          "Then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the Mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from Ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "We need rules to prevent that in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",
          "The immigration emergency, just as the Nigerian mafia emergency never existed, just as the emergency of drug dealers who continued to camp out in the middle of the streets, even when Italians were locked inside their homes, never existed.",
          "And I say this because for years here we have been told that there was the tragedy of refugees faced with images of boats full of single men of working age.",
          "The hateful phenomenon of illegal construction and unfair competition in trade, tourism, services, manufacturing, etc.",
          "The decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",
          "Because among the many falsehoods that I have heard in recent hours there is the one according to which these people, let's say, were shipwrecked due to the government's measures on non-governmental organizations.",
          "A series of names you just have to make a cross.",
          "We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",
          "the immigration issue.",
          "What are the measures?",
          "Regimes that had trampled on those fundamental values ​​and rights that have become a common heritage of Western democracies and that we often mistakenly tend to take for granted today.",
          "It also means hitting the traffickers who are behind it.",
          "Firefights The people who organize the departures of illegal migrants towards Italy go around armed and I don't want to help these people because I fight all the mafias.",
          "But refugees are not about welcoming a community, giving hospitality to a community that in Italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules.",
          "The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",

          "I think of the fact that we have had concrete references, for example to migration issues, in line with what is the Rome process, our conference on development and migration with India, the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Arabia Saudi, United Emirates.",

          "Why the drafts The draft conclusions If we look at the past on the topic of the external dimension, on the topic of the fact that the migration issue is a European issue on the topic of the specificity of the maritime border, which obviously needs different responses, it is a huge step ahead of the past.",
          "The memorandum is a starting point which will have to be followed by various agreements to ground the objectives we have set ourselves.",

Then I want to be the first to be frank.",
          "We have always claimed the need for Europe to deal more with the Mediterranean front.",

          "Above all because in our opinion this is one of the most effective ways to help the so-called exoduses of the one hundred and ten, that is, those companies that have remained in the hands of those people who have been left in the hands of credits and money for work done that they risk not seeing and therefore we must facilitate the purchase of those credits.",
          "We must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "To dispose of these credits.",
          "Families and entrepreneurs are increasingly resorting to usurious credit, because the banks, immobilized by regulations that are too stringent, are actually unable to respond to the current demand for credit.",
          "In our opinion, in this difficult situation it is essential for the banking system to behave, so to speak, in the most correct manner possible.",
          "Because in all of this, since there have been many scams in this matter, obviously those who have to acquire the credit are afraid of being co-responsible for anyone who may have generated a scam.",
          "A reform of the anti-usury law is needed to overcome delays and bureaucratic cumbersomeness that until now have hindered the submission of complaints by victims.",
          "But the second and more complex question concerns the fact that the super bonus created by the then Giallorossi government envisaged the possibility that the credit I had when I was doing the work towards the State could be transferable.",
          "Because it is obvious that if I have to put ten percent of what I am spending I will be more careful, more careful to look at how much I spend and to see if, for example, prices have not in some cases increased for no reason.",
          "At the same time it should also facilitate the transfer by companies that find themselves burdened by credits that have remained closed in their tax drawers.",
          "On the other hand we said that in the future it will no longer be possible to exceed those credits.",
          "However, unfortunately this has not always happened and we are therefore recording record profits from many banking institutions.",
          "This change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "Trace who had generated that credit now you understand that such a system lends itself a little to scams and also lends itself a little to creating, no, a bubble that increases this mechanism.",
          "Instead we want to push as much as possible banks, companies and all the actors involved to allow the acquisition of credits that are already at a standstill, those so-called stranded credits, i.e.",
          "We have made a rule that allows us to say Don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
          "You cannot assign the credit you have generated to another actor.",
          "But it's obvious that for goodness' sake, if you take someone's credit and you haven't even gone to check whether not only the work has been done, but whether the property exists as happened, you are co-responsible because in short, a minimum of control should done, but if you couldn't have known some things.",
          "Which means that if we left the transferability of those credits throughout this year, at the end of this year we would have at least another forty million euros.",
          "For this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",
          "Thanks to Brothers of Italy, a rule has been arrived at that corrects the issue of the joint liability of banks or in any case of suppliers in excess of the credits, who are now liable for their behavior only in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",

          "What is written in the Brothers of Italy program is sterilization, that is, if the price rises beyond a certain threshold, the State earns in excess of excise duties and VAT it uses to lower the price.",
          "I hear it said on television by even respectable commentators that the price of petrol in Italy would be around two and a half euros.",
          "Now here is something that needs to be explained everyone all the petrol stations in Italy are required to communicate to the institutions if they make price changes some do not make these communications.",
          "After that, there is certainly an intervention that needs to be done with regards to the motorway network, where sometimes the price is can be significantly higher by virtue of the concessions, because sometimes in service stations the motorway manager gives a sub concession and in this passage sometimes some rules are skipped and therefore I think that on this too we need to make the concessionaires responsible for future concessions to monitor what happens.",
          "The European Union suddenly found itself hostage to Russian blackmail on gas and harnessed to an energy pricing mechanism that actually encourages speculation.",
          "Obviously the international question, the crisis in Ukraine, the the domino, so to speak, of consequences, which therefore obviously produces the issue of the need to give concreteness to a European solution on the issue of rising costs as soon as possible of energy on the topic of a note on a cap on the price of gas that was discussed.",
          "In the event that you do not comply with these requirements and we want to do, we have done something even more important and that is established that in each petrol station, in addition to the obligation to display the price at the pump of that petrol station, there is also the average daily price.",
          "what did we do first of all I wrote to the president of the Antitrust, that is to say the competition and market authority, and I asked him to check whether there are elements in the formation, in the dynamics of price formation, that don't work and which must be corrected, second point, I spoke with the general commander of the financial police, the financial police has started a fuel price plan duemilaventitre, that's what it's called and that is, it is starting a series of checks throughout the national territory, especially in relation to of those who have not complied in communicating the price changes.",
          "And obviously in many cases let's say the overlap between those who do not communicate their price changes and have higher prices, significantly higher than the others is possible and therefore we are going to check if there were any on the part of those who do not communicate the changes in their prices prices, wrong attitudes or attitudes with which one wants to take advantage of the difficult situation and in the Council of Ministers we have decided to strengthen the sanctioning rules against those who do not comply with these communications which are required by law and therefore become much more significant the sanctions you can come across.",
          "Now since I am a serious person and obviously I monitor the results of what I produce, I am monitoring the price of petrol.",
          "That is, we have not limited ourselves to explaining the good reasons that lead us to believe that the proposed regulation on codue emissions for light vehicles is inappropriate in its current form with the deadline of 2035 that we know we have illustrated, data in hand, that the same result can be achieved.",
          "Basic hygiene, petrol has reached two and twenty euros.",
          "Because first of all I hear about petrol costing two and a half euros and petrol is at an average of one euro point eight point second in the Brothers of Italy program it doesn't say that we would cut excise duties and I never talked about cutting excise duties as a priority in this election campaign.",
