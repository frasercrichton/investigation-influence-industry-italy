          "I ask Giuseppe to the President.",
          "Your home sees you, looks at you, is proud of your sacrifices and wants to thank you for those sacrifices.",
          "This is written in Giorgia Meloni's book for those who don't want to make propaganda and for those who are interested in talking about serious issues without having to hit someone just because they dislike them.",
          "It is the reason why we favor current spending over investments that have a significantly higher multiplier.",
          "It's ten years of compulsory schooling, which is exactly what I, for example, was saying yesterday before this video came out.",
          "Partly out of indifference, partly because they are always comfortably seated in their glossy radical chic living rooms.",
          "The government's sign of attention towards people who find themselves facing a difficult situation.",
          "But it also means that we must do this, which we did not have the courage to do enough in the past, that is, work to secure the territory.",
          "However, unfortunately this has not always happened and we are therefore recording record profits from many banking institutions.",
          "And then from the extension of benefits for companies in the South, the valorisation of quality production, up to the presentation of the project to transform post offices into one-stop shops for the public administration to guarantee everyone's right to have easy and fast services.",
          "Biden, who was praised by the big media in an anti-Trump key, is proving to be completely inadequate, as inadequate-inadequate.",
          "And this fugitive was caught.",
          "What always begins the hunt for Giorgia These are Letta's statements she says give me shivers.",
          "Among other things, even there, in short, it doesn't seem to me that the Republicans are government allies with the Democrats.",
          "Because we are so boring, we always say the same thing.",
          "Hope you are too.",
          "Don't make this symbolic gesture of being here to say thank you, to say that even though you are four thousand kilometers away from home, you are not far from home.",
          "We are not victims of that prejudice, as long as we do not consider that the role that others have defined for us is also the role to which we can aspire.",
          "But it has a broader value thanks to the discounts that the government has obtained from large-scale retailers.",
          "Did you succeed?",
          "What does applying prevention mean?",
          "Because you see, when you tell millions of Italians that I am a danger, a dangerous person for history, a person who could paradoxically kill millions of people, invade a state or do things that the people with whom I am lumped together have done.",
          "I've also heard it said but these poor kids can no longer have fun in Italy they will have to go abroad so look, I'll read you a message that I received today from a common citizen who says It's not that you can't do rap of course you can open your VAT number, rent or buy the place, hire a company that takes care of your security, hire legal staff.",
          "Um, we obviously talked a lot about the ongoing conflict and the consequences that conflict generates for our societies.",
          "We have demonstrated with facts that we care about this issue because everything we have done, the bulk of what we have done has been dedicated to this matter.",
          "Do you know that there are majority proposals on this matter too?",

          "Look, because I was in the opposition for many years and I don't remember ever being summoned by a Prime Minister on the basis of a proposal I had presented in Parliament.",
          "It should also be remembered that obviously this world produces more than half of our productions or Ps, therefore our productions of excellence and therefore, let's say, the presence of the government could not be missing, which as you know, has been present at all levels in these days.",
          "Now we all begin to assume our responsibilities.",
          "After that, in my opinion, the next step is to provide answers, no, to continue to work on the answers for which I already say a few days ago I had, speaking with Minister Piante Dosi, with the Undersecretary of Mantua, discussed the possibility of bringing together the Council of Ministers the next opportunity to give a sign of further attention certainly, but also of concreteness with respect to the steps that still need to be taken, here too I have heard Meloni is silent on this matter.",
          "An initial estimate of the damage to the roads has been made, but until we are sure that the situation will stop it becomes very difficult.",
          "But look, it's the story of all the great mafia fugitives, eh?",
          "Maybe it's not that easy.",
          "it is a maneuver resulting from political choices as was right and normal for a political government.",
          "But obviously this doesn't mean that the topic isn't close to our hearts.",
          "So accompany us okay, the important thing is that you continue not to let the message be mediated.",
          "Okay, so let's forget that cutting the tax wedge, money on families, money on the health fund, anything you can think of couldn't be done.",
          "They say it to me, to us, to the brothers of Italy, that we learned something about poverty, about the suburbs, about the harshness of life, on our own skin, not in the dissertations of the living rooms or by watching some documentary like this is how the poor.",
          "That is, there is something underneath, if not, frankly not.",
          "I believe that in short, everyone should be called to their responsibility, because here we face a situation that is not easy.",
          "And we will also approve another law that will say something else that is equally simple and sacrosanct: immediate eviction for illegal occupations of other people's homes, without exceptions, without stratagems.",
          "We have addressed the pension issue and we have done so seriously.",
          "On this we have proposed a work to be done together, to be completed in the next sixty days, on which I already have the availability of the CNEL and its president to understand if there is a margin for sharing solutions between the political forces and with the social partners that can be effective in promoting work.",
          "This has become a problem that we are trying to solve.",
          "but it is a nation that equally needs such a government, a government of free people, a government of people who have no masters, a government of people who cannot be blackmailed, a government of people who cannot be bought , of go, of a government made up of people who do not respond to a system of power.",
          "Forgive me, really surreal, surreal!",
          "We saw it with eh, let's say the unanimous tribute that was paid during the Atlantic Council, from the highest of generals to the lowest of soldiers.",
          "So obviously this thing here needs to be sorted out because in the meantime there have been a lot of scams and this has been widely talked about to date with estimates of around nine billion euros worth of scams, that is, jobs that haven't been done, jobs that would have been facts about buildings that don't exist, that is, every kind of scam, obviously possible and imaginable.",
          "In recent years many people have been overwhelmed by economic difficulties and a perverse system, instead of helping them, has ended up taking away their homes too.",
          "In detail, however, well, it was to tell you that I am happy with the climate that I found here in Brussels.",
          "No, but anyway I'm organizing the conservative camp.",
          "I even read about an agency in which the head of the Democratic Party of Foreign Policy, Lia Quartapelle, speaks, speaks in reference to one of my speeches of gasps.",
          "Don't you think there was a political signal?",
          "I agree with the cut, but in my opinion the priorities now were different.",
          "Afterwards, the president of the republic who represents all the institutions also went.",
          "I try to explain it in easy words.",
          "that they are the same for everyone, as we have already done in the midst of the pandemic, for example by immediately proposing the introduction of an instrument for the protection of VAT numbers that was based on the same rules as the redundancy fund.",
          "Now I will stop and it is you who must move forward in this ideal relay to do something historic.",
          "There is also an issue of precariousness that needs to be addressed.",
          "November 9th of nineteen eighty-nine, a watershed date in history, not only in that of Europe and the West, but in that of the entire world.",
          "Spreads rising, investors fleeing, people who, in order to govern, are willing to do so on the rubble.",
          "D'opera Fratelli D'italia has always intervened, asking that the current rules not be changed and repeatedly proposing measures to unblock the problem loan market and to encourage the resumption of work on construction sites.",
          "I can have cash if I can't spend that cash legally I will tend to do it illegally, so the more you lower the ceiling on cash, the more you favor evasion, the more you raise the ceiling on cash, the less you favor evasion.",
          "From the decree to protect strategic production sectors to the birth of the Committee for Made in Italy, passing through the battle that allowed us to avoid the exclusion of wine, red meat and cured meats from European funding for the promotion of agricultural products, we have reiterated that Italy intends to defend its infrastructure, its brand, its excellence from the two billion euros that we have allocated to interventions for the safety, adaptation and redevelopment of schools, of which seven hundred and ten million that we have released and one billion and two hundred million added from scratch until resources are increased to make universities more efficient for a total of one billion four hundred million.",
          "Because we are in a European market.",
          "But this wasn't what I wanted to do, I wanted, I know you were looking for me but we wouldn't have succeeded.",
          "Firstly because, as the financial police well say, who in fact say they are not worried about the increase in the cash limit, someone who wants to evade still evades.",
          "It is thanks to the spiritual, political and diplomatic work of a saint and a statesman like John Paul II, who said that Europe must breathe with two lungs, the Western one and the Eastern one.",
          "We have created an important support plan for those who give birth to children.",
          "Then the attacks will increase.",
          "Not the name of this party, because in short it's starting to be a bit surreal and ridiculous.",
          "Errors that need to be corrected.",
          "Almonst never.",
          "We will protect the house from foreclosures, illegal construction and also from assets disguised by the left",
          "In short, the desire to work together on many fronts.",
          "Well, it won't be an adventure, it's not a fire, it's not a fire that can die with the wind.",
          "No, I have no regrets.",
          "So at least all of you can understand the fundamental difference between us and them.",
          "I consider it shameful that Enrico Letta does an interview on c n n not to explain what he will do to the government of this nation, but to try to tell this nation abroad that if the center right wins the center right supported by more than half on paper of Italian citizens.",
          "Because I said something different.",
          "I want to be clear about one thing, what we are inaugurating today is above all a dialogue between equals based on mutual respect, because the relationship between Europe and the wider Mediterranean cannot be a relationship, let's say competitive, or even conflictual.. Then I want to be the first to be frank.",
          "I am sincerely close to the pain of those who have lost loved ones and to the communities that have been most affected.",
          "We asked ourselves if we had done at least one useful thing.",
          "I thought this lesson in quotes had done it",
          "I respect and appreciate them.",

          "Tomorrow Patrick Zaki will return to Italy and I wish him, from the bottom of my heart, a life of serenity and success.",
          "the main problem that has impacted Italian families this year has been inflation and it is an issue to which the government has dedicated various measures since the beginning of its mandate.",
          "But no one says that, for example in this financial measure for the first time there is a good measure against open-and-close companies, that is, against that plague which in Italy is worth billions of euros, of Eva, of tax evasion every year, of companies that open and close before the State begins to carry out checks, that is, on average after two years they do not pay a single euro to the Italian State, disappear and start again.",
          "Obviously it also depends on ours, our return, our ability to be credible, influential and esteemed as Italy knows how to be..",
          "the reform of the land register, is consistent with the guidelines of the p n r r and responds to the recommendations made by the Commission European Union to Italy on the subject of fiscal policy is written in the government document.",
          "The example of Germany is given, the example of France is given, but they are nations that have grown by more than twenty percent in the last twenty years, Italy has grown by two percent, as we thought that our wages could grow adequately if the economy wasn't growing, the two things are inevitably linked.",
          "The theme here is if you want to do something, whatever you want to do, you do it respecting the rules and laws of the Italian state because there isn't some idiot who respects them and someone else who doesn't have to respect them, this Italy here, as I see it, it's over, that is, someone who knows how to do it better make their proposals but don't use hypotheses that have nothing to do with the rationale of the law and with our intention to prevent this State from saying that we are no longer the banana republic, because I don't follow them on this, I move forward and I believe that this is what Italians expect from me and from the government currently in office",
          "It is a battle in which Italy continued with determination and this led to the end, despite there being great resistance to bring the whole of Europe to a proposal that in short we were among the first, if not the first, to do, which is a huge signal for Italian and European families and businesses and shows that in short, when you take a little with determination and a little stubbornness the results can come.",
          "We are working on this thanks to the position of the Italian government.",
          "Did you expect, after the trips with the Fun de line to Tunis, that France and Germany would suddenly say, keep them, eh?",
          "And that is the Italy that we want to encourage.",
          "So yes, in Italy there is a serious problem of low wage levels.",
          "And it is a job with which Italy once again demonstrates its ability to be, yes, a nation that knows how to offer heroism, which knows how to offer sacrifice, which knows how to offer professionalism, but which also knows how to offer humanity.",
          "And because today I meet an Italy that is giving very encouraging signals, giving employment, growth, consumer confidence, investor confidence, an Italy respected on an international level and therefore I am, let's say at peace with myself, for the work I did.",
          "I come from the GSette, as you know and independently of the GSette, where there was also great availability, great solidarity.",
          "And I asked what the contracts were with which these irregular immigrants that we want to bring into Italy would work and I was told national collective contract.",
          "Italy has worked a lot in recent years, above all with the aim of representing more, how can I say, a limit rather than a stimulus to the creation of wealth.",
          "Doing business in Italy has practically become a heroic act.",

          "And we hope that we can arrive at a serious, shared response to this, but one that improves the condition of Italian workers overall and does not improve the condition of some, while worsening that of others.",

          "I simply think that the problem of the left is that it is a bit short on arguments and you know why it is short on arguments it is short on arguments because we, by governing, are dismantling the narrative of an unpresentable right, of an authoritarian right , of a right incapable of governing and we are demonstrating in Italy and beyond national borders that it can exist instead.",

          "Because the great objective that we have always given ourselves in life and that we have given ourselves as a political force, was to ensure that Italians could once again be proud of being Italian, of waving the tricolor flag",
          "Italy alive, brothers of Italy",
          "If we have brothers from Italy as a driving force, we have the certainty that the government with the Democratic Party does not exist because I do not have a government with the left five-star Democratic Party, Renzi and company..",
          "Okay, Italy is lost.",

          "Unfortunately there is no index of names in my book.",
          "Because yes, Italy can be the leader and protagonist.",

          "Gianmarco.",
          "Meanwhile, the famous democratic party says on television that if the brothers of Italy democratically won the elections they could govern it.",
          "no, sorry, but he's schizophrenic.",

          "Italian by studying our know-how.",
          "Partly due to an ideological approach, because security, after all, for them is a right-wing thing, state intervention is needed immediately, now the restoration of security and legality and the fight against degradation are among the priorities of the brothers of Italy, starting from greater control of the territory.",
          "So you have to look for the symbol of the brothers of Italy, make a cross on both cards, fold the cards and you have made the revolution",

          "Laura Boldrini it is let's say, a modern enough right to be able to govern by expressing Giorgia Meloni, prime minister No, soon we will see the messages, we will see the polls which in any case already anticipate you, they give brothers of Italy this first Italian party.",
          "This week we will take Giorgia's notes in the square in Piazza del Popolo on Saturday afternoon at half past five.",
          "On the symbol of the brothers of Italy we mean the party and you have voted now, however, keep in mind that compared to how you see it here the symbol will not necessarily be here or here because it changes in all the constituencies.",

          "I therefore confirm that we intend to modify this rule without taking these resources away from their original destination, which is young people and culture.",
          "Here too it is worth recounting some data in Rome, here we are talking about ten apartments in the ater, therefore public residential buildings, that is, public housing which were partly occupied by criminal families..",
          "I mean, there are several companies that ask the government within the flow decree on immigration to let in some immigrants who they need to do jobs.",
          "Furthermore, three private homes plus one belonging to the INPS were evicted.",
          "We do this to comply with international law.",
          "as far as the rule on raves is concerned, look, I agree with what I heard the plant minister Tosi say if I'm not mistaken today in an interview if anyone has ideas to improve the rule and Parliament exists for this,",
          "But this was certainly the case with regards to the migration dossier.",
          "And I say this because for years here we have been told that there was the tragedy of refugees faced with images of boats full of single men of working age.",
          "The decree provides for an increase in penalties for migrant trafficking, but above all provides for the introduction of a new type of crime relating to death or serious injuries, as a consequence of trafficking of illegal immigrants which provides for these criminals to be punished with a penalty up to thirty years of imprisonment.",
          "But refugees are not about welcoming a community, giving hospitality to a community that in Italy sees many integrated people, respectful of our rules.",
          "Um, obviously beyond the issue of respect for international law, the value of sovereignty and freedom of a nation.",
          "International law provides something very clear: you are obliged to save someone if you accidentally meet them and if someone is at risk.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "I was also moved.",
          "It also means hitting the traffickers who are behind it.",
          "But I also want to tell you that the issue of so-called relocations is secondary in the very complex situation we are facing.",
          "Around twenty-five thousand people, but also in Campania around one hundred and eight thousand new hires are expected and therefore there seems to be some possibility of finding employment.",
          "We do not want in any way to continue to favor human traffickers.",
          "If you are a cancer patient and want to take a ferry to go for surgery from Sardinia to Rome you cannot get on the ferry and thousands of unvaccinated illegal immigrants disembark.",
          "That is, for us, anyone who is responsible for serious injuries or death while organizing human trafficking can be prosecuted with a crime that we consider to be a universal crime..",
          "The government does not intend to change its position on the issue of immigration.",
          "The route is not covered by non-governmental organizations and therefore the government's measures on non-governmental organizations have nothing to do with this, with this matter, I point out to you and I believe you must bear witness to the fact that despite us continuing to work to stop the flows of illegal immigration, also to prevent people from dying, we have since the beginning of this government continued to save all the people we could save when we were aware that they were at risk.",
          "But to carry out this commitment it is necessary to know data and numbers, to understand in depth the scenario in which to move, to have in our eyes and hearts the stories of those who suffer abuse, persecution, violence.",
          "What happens if these rules are not respected is that there is no authorization to enter international waters and if that authorization is violated the vessel is administratively detained the first time for two months, the second time with seizure for the purposes of confiscation.",
          "We need rules to prevent that um, in gathering these people on board we do not jeopardize the safety of the vessel we are approaching, stringent regulations that allow us to respect international law.",
          "No, it would not be the barricades on the Bolkestein, that is, which liberalizes the public concessions of the sea.",
          "They must go to families who do not have the possibility of having a home and who often find themselves sleeping under a bridge because the public housing is occupied by criminal families.",
          "We are used to an Italy that is mainly concerned with going in search of migrants throughout the Mediterranean.",
          "we dealt with immigration in the same Council of Ministers with a decree which mainly concerns the issue of NGOs which has as its objective the respect of international law because trivially the international law on rescue at sea does not provide that there is someone who can make the ferry in the Mediterranean or any other sea and go back and forth with smugglers to transfer people from one country to another.",
          "It means not only targeting those traffickers we find on the boats.",
          "Well, I am moved, I am often moved, but I found many people moved, clearly moved by the tragedy they were experiencing, but also moved by Speranza No and I was saying for us it is important to give immediate answers.",
          "Why the drafts The draft conclusions If we look at the past on the topic of the external dimension, on the topic of the fact that the migration issue is a European issue on the topic of the specificity of the maritime border, which obviously needs different responses, it is a huge step ahead of the past.",
          "Also, sorry, but how is this defense of illegal raves compatible in your opinion?",
          "We want to fight to stop the illegal trafficking of approximately three hundred thousand puppies that arrive from Eastern Europe and are sold in Italy every year for thousands of euros as purebred dogs, after having undergone endless days of travel in pitiful conditions.. And then we want to expand pet therapy activities and where possible we will let our animal friends enter nursing homes and hospitals, because even the company of those who love us is therapy.",
          "I heard that we want to ban demonstrations.",
          "for those who hire women or young people up to thirty-six years old or recipients of citizenship income.",
          "We want to fight human trafficking, we want to fight illegal entries, we want to fight deaths at sea.",
          "Preventing people from having fun as I have heard, the issue is to prevent this from being done illegally.",
          "This, from my point of view, changes many things in the European approach to the migration issue.",
          "The immigration emergency, just as the Nigerian mafia emergency never existed, just as the emergency of drug dealers who continued to camp out in the middle of the streets, even when Italians were locked inside their homes, never existed.",
          "you know that there are almost twenty million dogs and cats that live in our homes as four-legged family members.",
          "For them, the problem of illegal maxi raves didn't exist, when instead the discos had to stay closed because otherwise there was a risk of contagion.",
          "Immigration is a European problem and needs a European response.",
          "Yet it is estimated that every year around eighty thousand cats and fifty thousand dogs are abandoned, more than eighty percent of which risk dying from accidents or starvation.. Pets are part of the family in every respect and Brothers of Italy intends to fight to guarantee them a dignified and loving life among our initiatives already launched in this legislature.",
          "The images of these hours are a boulder on certain lies and coincidentally, faced with a clear distinction between refugees and economic migrants.",
          "those which are no longer compensable and which no one wants to take and which therefore they are currently not transferable.",
          "First point if you come across a boat and save people you have to take them to safety and therefore you don't keep them on board the ship while you continue to make other multiple rescues until the ship is full, because that doesn't mean putting the safe people and above all it doesn't mean accidentally rescuing shipwrecked people.",
          "Yes, these people with us instead of the citizen's income of taking the citizen's income without working while staying at home, um, they will be helped to actually find a job for those who know poverty.",
          "This is what we called the Mattei plan, that is, a cooperation strategy that is centered on an equal relationship, a relationship of mutual growth and interest to guarantee African populations the fundamental right not to be forced to migrate in search of a better life.",
          "the immigration issue.",
          "What this government wants to do is go and look for smugglers all over the globe.",
          "Now this is a topic on which I have read and heard a lot of controversy and many falsehoods and I think it is useful to clarify things a little.. First, they do not lose their citizenship income.",
          "This means firmly combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, it means protecting those who have the right to international protection and managing legal immigration in an orderly manner through flow decrees.. All within a framework of responsibility that must also involve the other European states.",
          "I think of the fact that we have had concrete references, for example to migration issues, in line with what is the Rome process, our conference on development and migration with India, the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, Arabia Saudi, United Emirates.",
          "businesses and citizens left respectively with tax credits and blocked jobs who are prisoners of the frequent regulatory changes.",
          "also on the topic of citizenship income I want to try to be clear because I know that this is a city in which no, there are many recipients of citizenship income and I want to say to these people don't be afraid because I don't want to leave anyone behind.",
          "Then we ask that there be, let's say, coherence between the activity that some ships carry out in the Mediterranean and what they are registered for, because obviously these are the activities of various commercial ships that go back and forth to rescue migrants, which is quite jarring, after which we need to screen those on board.",
          "Obviously we want to respect international law.",
          "Except that that route is not covered by NGOs and therefore this simply demonstrates that the point is that the more people leave, the more people risk dying.",
          "There are many more who have lost their citizenship income.",
          "That is, very few people have been relocated in recent months, so it's a bit like, let's say, a Linus blanket.",
          "Well, starting next week we are working on new rules to stop trafficking, because we don't intend to give up on this issue.",
          "According to data from the scientific evaluation committee of the P n R R of the Ministry of Labour, there are approximately fifty percent of the recipients of citizenship income and practically none of these people have found a job thanks to those mythological Navigators which are another brilliant idea of ​​the Five Star Movement.",
          "If you don't have the green pass, then we had a virus that came from China, but we don't want to import the Chinese model.",
          "and it's time colleagues to call some things by their name, recognize the refugee status of those fleeing from Ukraine, mothers and children who are actually fleeing from the war and perhaps take advantage at the same time to repatriate those who are here.",
          "Which can happen within national borders.",
          "Mass immigration is a phenomenon of very wide scope, which obviously concerns the lives of migrants, which concerns the protection of the most vulnerable, but which also concerns the safety of citizens and the social protection of our societies.",
          "We have begun to defend our borders from human traffickers, from support for Ukraine to the Mattei plan for Africa, through over sixty contacts and meetings with the leaders of as many nations.",
          "And for this reason I reiterate that the government does not intend to bow to the many and powerful pressures of those who would like to impose the ideological vision of a world without national borders in the name of an indefinite right to migrate.",
          "risk that at a certain point someone decides to free the world from this very dangerous person, because maybe there are some wheels out of place and he doesn't understand the game there is.",

          "Council of Ministers approved several measures, the most important of which, in my opinion, is the taxation on unfair margins of banks.",
          "We decided to introduce a forty percent tax on the unfair difference in the interest margin, that is, what is the unfair difference in the interest margin is the difference between the amount of interest expense and interest income of banks, that is, the difference on how much the banks charge you to lend you money and how much they recognize you when you deposit the money.",
          "And what we intend to do and what we are starting to do in part because in the financial package there is, for example, a total exemption from contributions for those who employ certain categories of people, including those receiving citizen's income.",

          "Six billion is a small thing compared to the tens and tens of billions currently thrown away in useless bonuses, we can take the resources from there.",
          "For this reason, the objective of our work must also be to find the resources necessary to carry out these development initiatives, involving not only states and international organizations, but also enhancing private and entrepreneurial initiatives.. And I am sure that the discussion that we are about to start in this session, in the following one, which also involves international financial organizations and institutions, will direct us towards ambitious and shared goals.",
          "The government has allocated over one billion euros for Regions and autonomous provinces, to limit the impact of payback in medical devices, on companies in the sector and to strengthen emergency rooms.",
          "In any case, clearly many resources will have to be mobilized and here too the government is already working to understand what the priority funds can and should be, from which the priority situations from which to draw.",
          "For this we have huge resources that come from the European Social Fund which serves exactly this objective.",
          "Therefore, the medium-term objective that the government has set itself is to overcome the logic of fragmented interventions by launching a large hydrogeological prevention plan.",
          "But you know that in some cases they are already mobilized on existing projects and must be spent by two thousand twenty-six.",
          "On the one hand we certainly have an enormous need to defend the competitiveness of our system, but not because the United States has angered the Infn Reduction Act, but because it is a moment in which we must question the choices that they have, for example in terms of supply chains, returned to controlling their own fundamental supply chains.",
          "We are also talking to the entire supply chain.",
          "How to be able to work together to implement plans in such a way that these resources can actually reach the ground, also thinking about what are the big priorities today.",
          "We will convene all the trade associations, therefore the companies involved, to understand what else we can do to help them, to give them a hand, to save these companies, to save these workers and to put this measure back on a sensible track, on a track sensible.",
          "For this reason, from a mutually beneficial partnership perspective, I believe that the first objective of this conference should be to launch development initiatives and projects for the wider Mediterranean region of sub-Saharan Africa through the joint planning and implementation of initiatives and projects which from my point of view should focus mainly on the structural aspects of agriculture, energy, infrastructure, education and training, healthcare, water, hygiene.",
          "I'm happy that we're talking about p n r r because evidently we agree on the fact that in some cases you have to spend resources in the best possible way, even re-discussing if necessary, something that is less urgent.",
          "It's the reason why we don't have an industrial policy strategy, it's a reason why we don't have a strategy for many things.",
          "The government has made all the means at its disposal available to support the work of the Regions.",
          "We have focused resources on those priorities.",
          "And above all, the State can intervene immediately to allocate more resources to reduce the bills of families and businesses with direct aid and tax credits.",
          "As you know, in recent weeks and at the last meeting of the European Council, important steps forward have been made, to which concrete solutions must be given today, obviously in the shortest time possible.. And then, obviously, we talked about the resources of how to best spend the resources of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, as well as in the face of the difficulties that exist, increase in the costs of raw materials, inflation.",
          "Look on the p n R r. I've heard things said incorrectly, I've heard people talk about nine billion, etc.",
          "If there are changes to be made also on European funds, I think we will not encounter any difficulties on this.",
          "Yesterday we launched a major economic corridor project between the European Union, the Middle East and India, a network of maritime and rail connections that will release, from my point of view, enormous potential for our trade and our businesses..",
          "We want to broaden the range of potential beneficiaries of the Solidarity Fund for victims of extortion and usury not only to economic activities, for example, but also to families and individuals.",
          "But now it's a matter of better organizing the entire supply chain and therefore also talking to each other more.",
          "I believe these are the most urgent things.",
          "The resources that the PNR allocates to these cases are around two and a half billion.",
          "The possibility of partially using European funds can be agreed in Europe, as has already been done in the past.",
          "Another important chapter of our work in recent days concerns healthcare.",
          "Part of these resources are recovered from a redefinition of the rule on extra profits which should overcome, let's say, some of the elements that were at the basis of the disputes that were raised and allow us to recover around two and a half billion.",
          "Which First Nations provide assistance?",
          "But even more important will be the information and training campaigns on respect for animals which must be carried out starting from schools.",
          "In short, we continue to believe that imagining a sovereign fund to support businesses, working on full flexibility of existing funds must be issues to be discussed and put on the table at a time when some who have greater fiscal space than others ask for easing of rules on state aid, the mission of France, Germany, Washington was Look, frankly, the invitation to Zelanski yesterday seemed more inappropriate to me, because I believe that the strength, our strength in this matter is unity and compactness.",
          "In particular cases of hardship with those same European funds, it is also possible to provide economic support during that training period.",
          "With the resources that we recover we will help finance the measures to support family businesses in the face of difficulties linked to the cost of money or the high cost of money which often do not even allow them to face the costs of a mortgage peacefully.",
          "There are ways to finance these interventions: the extra revenue can be used, i.e.",
          "But I believe that at this stage we need to work more on other funds that also concern Europe.",
          "In any case, the resources needed will be identified to do things, that is, what interventions are already being thought of.",
          "I believe that the contents and things that can be purchased with these resources should be better defined.",
          "After that, the European Solidarity Fund is a fund that in my opinion, for example, is one of the funds that can be used.",
          "One hundred and twenty million euros have been allocated together with third sector associations, which I also thank for setting up the Food Bank, to further help families who are even more in difficulty.",
          "And what do we do with these resources?",
          "Many small, large initiatives.",
          "The twenty million are now used to guarantee paradoxical relief.",
          "This is perhaps now one of the most strategic things to do to understand where responsibility should lie, to understand how we can concentrate all the resources we have at what are now many institutional levels and try to concentrate them to immediately spend what we can spend.",

          "Now the question everyone is asking is whether I set a minimum wage by law does it become an additional parameter, that is, one that protects those who do not fall within this protection or does it become a substitute parameter because if it became a substitute parameter there would be more workers who they lose those who earn in a fragment, but those who earn less, as you think, those who earn less is the issue that needs to be addressed which is not necessarily resolved at the minimum wage, because for example, many are children of irregular work.",
          "Approximately eighty-two percent have a minimum hourly wage higher than the nine euros required by law.",
          "For this reason I have chosen to meet the opposition starting from the specific proposal of the minimum wage because the issue of combating poor work interests us, as long as we understand the fact that the subject is an extremely broad subject and that it must be addressed in its entirety complexity.",
          "Because if the legal minimum wage is the solution, why didn't the parties that are now clamoring for it introduce it in the long years in which they were in government?",
          "The issue could have been addressed in another way and I mean more, the same scheme could have been used in all public offices, with clearly productivity that would have increased and in companies instead of preventing those who do not have the green pass the booster of being able to earn a salary to feed your children.",
          "Therefore, as you know from the beginning of its mandate, this government has concentrated most of its energy on the issue of salary management, on the issue of helping families.",
          "In my opinion, saying let's try to work together on a proposal that comprehensively addresses an issue that looks at the minimum wage alone, I'm afraid it won't solve.",
          "A risk that supporters of the minimum wage evidently do not take into consideration, but which in my opinion should be taken into consideration.",
          "But then why didn't we accept the opposition's proposal on the legal minimum wage as it was presented?",
          "And imagine if he is not sensitive to the issue of increasing wages.",
          "Because obviously it's the risk that we end up with a minimum wage rule.",
          "Fair work, paid adequately as this government has particularly demonstrated, putting most of its resources on cutting the contribution wedge, guaranteeing adequate wages and defending the purchasing power of families is one of our absolute priorities.",
          "Paradoxically, to look after their interests, the large economic concentrations, which are the only ones that would gain from a generalized reduction in wages, are, let's say, within reach.",
          "The cost of living is increasing and I really can't understand anyone who can even argue about this choice.",
          "I am thinking of the issue of strengthening the lowest wages, particularly with the cut in the contribution wedge.",
          "And besides, there must be some reason why those who today say that the minimum wage is the answer to every problem in the ten years they were in government didn't think to do so..",
          "But we are obviously open to discussion on the subject, which is much broader than poor work and adequate wages.",
          "I believe that it is much more effective to extend collective bargaining even in sectors where it is not currently foreseen.",
          "There are disagreements on what the tools are to strengthen the purchasing power of families, to strengthen wages.",
          "But I want to say that to achieve this objective, I have already said it in the past, in a context like the Italian one which is characterized by a high, high coverage of collective bargaining by a high rate of irregular work, the government is not convinced that the solution is the setting of a legal minimum wage.",
          "If I'm wrong, you fear that the nine euro minimum wage is a trap for those who have a better income.",
          "Look, what I want to do is simply give a signal of attention and respect on an issue that is close to my heart, because unlike those who today propose a minimum wage from the opposition, but when they were in government they did not implement the minimum wage.",
          "That is, the paradox is that the minimum wage could risk becoming a substitute parameter and not an additional one, with the result of paradoxically worsening the wages of many more workers than those for whom it would improve it..",
          "And already in the first months of the legislature, despite the inevitably limited resources we have available, we have given signals in this sense, interventions to protect the purchasing power of families and workers, the renewal of the two-point cut percentages of the tax and contribution wedge which it is worth remembering the previous government had foreseen until the end of last year and the addition of a further point of the contribution cut for the lowest incomes.",
          "I think it is an excellent sign of confidence for our economy and we must say that it is above all the effect of the work we have done to combat high energy prices.",
          "And I apologize to you for the simple minimum wage measure which, as you know, according to many also according to many trade unions, according to many experts in the sector, in a nation like ours, with very high collective bargaining, risks worsening, paradoxically, the condition more workers than those for whom it could improve it.",
          "On the remaining ten billion we had two choices: either cut excise duties for everyone, even the rich, or take those resources and concentrate them on medium-low incomes which is the choice we made.",
          "Now, in my opinion, let's say he will question me on the hypothesis that the legal minimum wage could become not a substitute parameter and let's say a parameter.",
          "These are obviously first steps towards the objective that the government has set itself, which is obviously to increase workers' wages, guaranteeing decent wages, wages that are adequate for the work performed and the socio-economic context.",
          "Obviously on an economic level it is one of our great priorities and it clearly interests us when the question of strengthening wages is raised.",
          "From the extension of the Solidarity Fund for mortgages and the guarantee fund for the purchase of the first home for young couples, through to the rule that allows everyone to transform the variable rate mortgage into a fixed rate mortgage, we have given a hand in defending the right to housing from the fiscal truce to the extension of the flat tax for self-employed and VAT numbers, up to the cut in taxation on productivity bonuses and on the highest declared incomes, through the tax relief on tips and the extension of the suspension on Plastic and Sugar Tax, we have begun to build a state that is friendlier to those who produce, from raising the ceiling to the use of cash to the norm to combat open-and-close companies.",
          "Really who concentrated on increasing wages?",
          "Ninety-seven percent of these contracts are signed by CGIL, CISL and UIL and these contracts all also provide for a minimum wage for each sector.. Now, in light of this, if I decided to establish by law a minimum hourly wage for everyone which inevitably will have to be, let's say in the middle, I would find myself with a legal minimum wage which in many cases could be reasonably lower than my minimum contractual agreement foreseen for several of these national contracts.",
          "And if instead in those three years he had had the opportunity to work and improve himself, he would have been richer and poorer..",
          "Including legal minimum wage, which has not been approved in the past.",
          "For this reason, in the next few days we will open discussions with the opposition and try to understand if there is room to present together a serious, serious proposal against low wages, which can provide wage parameters for those sectors and those workers who are not covered and guaranteed by collective bargaining, which at the same time can increase controls to combat irregular work, false part-time contracts and other practices, or rather other crimes of the kind.",
          "Another much discussed topic in the political debate is that of wages and specifically the hypothesis of a minimum wage by law.",
          "The bulk of his measures are those who defend poor work as I hear some political exponents say and who instead has led to the inadequate wages we have today are friends of the workers because now that he is in opposition he is proposing the minimum wage?",

          "In this way, self-employed people who lose their jobs are protected and undeclared work is discouraged, always on the side of those who work, in whatever form they do so.",

          "For this reason we have blocked the possibility of transferring those credits for the future and we have better defined the responsibility of those who take that credit.",
          "This change is a first step which obviously serves to facilitate the unblocking of the credit market and allow banks and other entities to operate with greater serenity.",
          "And obviously it also happened that the bubble inflated so much that at a certain point those who had these credits, mainly companies, could no longer compensate them because they had exhausted, let's say, their possibility of compensating that credit with taxes and could no longer not even to sell them, because even the fiscal drawers of the banks of the other actors who could buy those credits have closed and there are perfectly honest people who have done some work, who have trusted the State, who have done what the State said which found itself in the hands of some work done and money that it cannot take because this has produced this very interesting free measure that today we have thousands of companies that risk collapse and therefore since we inherited it, we now have to look for a solution to prevent thousands of companies from risking collapse because someone could say during the election campaign that they renovated houses for free and that's exactly what we tried to do.",
          "We must facilitate access to credit even for those in difficulty, with more streamlined regulations and by strengthening public guarantees that are intended for those at risk of usury.",
          "We have made a rule that allows us to say Don't worry, please, acquire the credit because we have to save these companies and these workers put in a tragic situation by someone who evidently was not serious enough in writing this measure.",
